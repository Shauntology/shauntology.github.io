1 CONC d neither married nor had children. This younger John Peach married Alic

1 CONT Previously published research has claimed that the two cousins emigrate
1 CONC d together, some going so far as to say that they travelled on the "Mar
1 CONC y and John" in 1630 (because this ship contained mostly passengers fro
1 CONC m the west country of England-- likely origins of both Peaches).  Anders
1 CONC on, in his 1993 compilation of a new synthetic passenger list for this s

1 CONC e  1774: 2 TEXT (THEORY)<p>I believe illegitimate son of Elizabeth South
1 CONC well (Sir Walter Devereux) could be the father of our 1615 John Devereux
1 CONC . Feel free to correct me if you see any flaws in this theory.In my min
1 CONC d an illegitimate line of the Lord Devereux family is more likely to imm
1 CONC igrate over the legitimate branches. With that being said...
1 CONT                                                                         
1 CONC                Here's why I saw potential in this theory:
1 CONT                                                                         
1 CONC                </p><p><br />The London City Directory showed a Mr. Walte
1 CONC r Devereux living at 38 Triggs Stairs in St. Peter, Paul’s Wharf Parish
1 CONC . This may indicate Walter was establishing his own residence. Of additi
1 CONC onal interest is the listing of a Mr. Devorax living on Trigg’s Lane an
1 CONC d paying rent of 6L. This Mr. Devorax was listed as John Devorax when on
1 CONC e of his servants was buried. This suggests a possible link between Walt
1 CONC er and a John Devereux possibly a son.</p><p>Years after Walter Devereux
1 CONC ‘s death in 1641, a Dorothy Deverix died and was recorded in the Registe
1 CONC r of St. Peter, Paul’s Wharf as a widow upon her burial in the churchyar
1 CONC d on 27 Sep 1649. There is further suggestion that about 1609 they may h
1 CONC ave had a son, John. This John Devereux was a retainer of Sir John Astle
1 CONC y and mentioned in his Will. The Astley family was involved in staging t
1 CONC he revels common to the nobility at this time and clearly was interconne
1 CONC cted with the Devereux family. Walter Devereux participated in these pla
1 CONC ys and dramas as well. On February 2, 1618 he performed in “The Fairies
1 CONC ’ Farewell: The Masque at Coleorton” at his half-sister, Frances Devereu
1 CONC x’s marriage to Sir William Seymour.</p><p>In 1639 the First Bishops' Wa
1 CONC r breaks out between Charles I and the Scottish Church. Essex participat
1 CONC es, but unlike the previous conflict there is no record that Walter acco
1 CONC mpanied him. When Parliament is summoned by Charles I  Walter Devereux i
1 CONC s elected to Commons for Lichfield in East Staffordshire. On April 13 th
1 CONC e ‘Short Parliament’ begins, but is dissolved May 5 after refusing to gr
1 CONC ant the King money.</p><p>As the Second Bishops War ends in disaster, Ch
1 CONC arles I summons parliament again on September 24, and Walter Devereux i
1 CONC s a member for Lichfield in East Staffordshire once more. The ‘Long Parl
1 CONC iament’ begins on November 3, and Walter Devereux serves on the Ship-mon
1 CONC ey Committee and is named one of the Commissioners for Staffordshire i
1 CONC n the Scandalous Ministers Act. He continues to be active in Parliament
1 CONC ’s cause throughout 1641 when he died unexpectedly on July 26.As the Par
1 CONC liament began to prepare for military action against the King, Essex’s r
1 CONC elationships with his family deteriorated. His mother’s second husband
1 CONC , the Earl of Clanricade, and his sister’s husband, Earl of Hertford, we
1 CONC re Royalists. He was barely speaking to his wife who would soon go ove
1 CONC r to the Royalist camp. Essex was alienated from all those he had held d
1 CONC ear only five years previously, but sensing imminent death he set his af
1 CONC fairs in order. On August 5, 1642, Essex would revise his Will includin
1 CONC g reassigning the estates he had deeded to Walter Devereux to his sister
1 CONC , the Marchioness of Hereford, and his favorite nephew, Sir Charles Shir
1 CONC ley.</p><p>As Walter Devereux had died unexpectedly intestate at Essex H
1 CONC ouse, London, there was no will. His half-brother, Robert Devereux, mad
1 CONC e no allowance for surviving family, but this was typical of nobility a
1 CONC t the time. In the Herbert family, that were also from the same Welsh bo
1 CONC rder region, there is a clear example where the legitimate brother compl
1 CONC etely excluded the illegitimate brother’s family from all inheritance o
1 CONC f any family wealth. The possible wife of Walter, Dorothy Deverix, die
1 CONC d on 27 Sep 1649.</p><p>The main part of Essex House was demolished som
1 CONC e time between 1674 and 1679. Essex Street was built on part of the site
1 CONC . One of those buildings was used in the mid-1770s as a Dissenters' meet
1 CONC ing house known as the Essex Street Chapel, where Unitarianism was firs
1 CONC t preached in England. The denominational headquarters are still on th
1 CONC e site, now called Essex Hall. Their building footprint is believed to i
1 CONC nclude the Tudor chapel of Essex House.There's more info if you look int
1 CONC o this. I believe I've also read Walter was raised by paternal grandmoth
1 CONC er (Lady Lettice Knollys) Again, this is just a theory that I had discov
1 CONC ered while digging through information online. I'd appreciate any help c
1 CONC ontinuing the search or closing this case with further investigating.

1 CONC e  1848: 2 TEXT Devereux was the son of Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Ess
1 CONC ex[1] and his mistress, Elizabeth Southwell.[2][3] Elizabeth Southwell w
1 CONC as the daughter of Thomas Southwell of Woodrising and his third wife, Na
1 CONC zareth Newton, and the half-sister of Vice Admiral Sir Robert Southwell.
1 CONC <p>The Earl acknowledged his son and made financial arrangements on hi
1 CONC s behalf with an addendum to his will in July 1595, "Walter Devereux th
1 CONC e base and reputed sonne of the said Robt Erle of Essex, begotten of th
1 CONC e body of Eliz: Southwell."[3] The intent of the deed is thought to hav
1 CONC e been the granting of Essex House to Walter Devereux, but there is no e
1 CONC vidence this disposition actually occurred. His only reported manor wa
1 CONC s that of Lamphey in Pembrokeshire, which comprised just 721 acres and y
1 CONC ielded a little over £203 in rents each year.[4] He sold Lamphey manor t
1 CONC o Richard Cuny in November 1618, whereupon his half-brother, Robert, 3r
1 CONC d earl of Essex, bestowed upon him the lease of Lamphey rectory.[4] Th
1 CONC e lack of adequate means was probably the principal cause that Devereu
1 CONC x spent most of his adult life in Essex's household in Staffordshire an
1 CONC d Westminster, and although he persistently described himself as bein
1 CONC g ‘of Lamphey’ there is no evidence to suppose that he ever lived there.
1 CONC </p><p>Walter was given over to the care of Essex's mother, Lettice (Kno
1 CONC llys) (Devereux) Dudley, Countess of Leicester, who raised him at Drayto
1 CONC n Bassett in Staffordshire. With the execution of his father, Robert Dev
1 CONC ereux, on 25 February 1601 he found himself stripped of his main sourc
1 CONC e of support. Essex's assets had been seized, and now Walter Devereux wa
1 CONC s an even greater social pariah, the illegitimate son of a traitor.</p><
1 CONC p>During this period after the 2nd Earl's execution, Walter was permitte
1 CONC d to continue his studies at Oxford, and matriculated from Queen's Colle
1 CONC ge, Oxford on 16 November 1604 at the age of 13. During this time he app
1 CONC arently drew closer to his half-brother, Robert Devereux, the legal hei
1 CONC r of the 2nd Earl and future 3rd Earl who also was suffering from thes
1 CONC e losses. Throughout the remainder of Walter's life, he would remain a r
1 CONC etainer of Robert, and when the title was restored in July 1603 Walter'
1 CONC s fortunes rose as well.

0 @N0352@ NOTE The story of Zentaro coming to the US
1 CONT 
1 CONT Not much is known by my side of the family but this is a short compilati
1 CONC on of my great grandfather.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Zentaro Meifu was born in the city of Fukioka, a then rural area which i
1 CONC s now the 6th largest city in Japan. He married his wife, Takawa, and ha
1 CONC d 3 children, 2 sons and a daughter. They lived in a small rural town cl
1 CONC ose to Fukioka but had dreams of escaping war-bound Japan. He made his d
1 CONC reams a reality and came to the United States to diligently work in th
1 CONC e booming costal areas of Santa Barbara, in the early 1900’s. He left hi
1 CONC s family for 8 lonely years before he had enough money to bring them al
1 CONC l to California. After the joyful reunion, he and his wife had 4 more ch
1 CONC ildren, George Takeo, and Katsumi, “Kat”, Mary, and Marie.
1 CONT 
1 CONT “Living the dream” was not always full of happy endings. One of his daug
1 CONC hters committed suicide and one of his sons hated America so much, he we
1 CONC nt back to Japan and was not heard of again. Zentaro also never learne
1 CONC d to speak English very well but instilled the notion in his children th
1 CONC at they should try their best to work hard and blend into the “American
1 CONC ” way of life. This proved to be a valuable council as WWII broke out i
1 CONC n the 1940’s and he, in his old age, was rounded up and put into a conce
1 CONC ntration camp in North Dakota- due to the fear of the Japanese-America
1 CONC n people being spies and traitors. One of his sons, George Takeo, had mo
1 CONC ved inland, and ended up in Salt Lake City, Utah- escaping the concentra
1 CONC tion camps and working hard to assimilate away from his Japanese heritag
1 CONC e. In the end, George was rejected by his family for assimilating- the v
1 CONC ery act that saved him from the fears of WWII.
