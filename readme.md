# Shauntology

## About

I am Shaun. I don't know how to code;  I am not a developer... so this project is just my attempt to build a site that represents my perceptions of being.

## Origins

The reason I started this sepecifically: to share discoveries with my relatives as I update our family tree, so we can tell our origin story.
