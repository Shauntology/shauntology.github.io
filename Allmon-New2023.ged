1 CONT

1 CONT evolved around a rural school that had been established by 1909 or 
1 CONT 1910. Classes continued until about 1935, when the school was 
1 CONT consolidated with the one in Petersburg. 
1 CONT 
1 CONT A cotton gin was established at Allmon around 1950 or 1951, and a grai
1 CONC n storage and elevator was 
1 CONT built later in the decade. A general store operated intermittently. In t
1 CONC he 
1 CONT late 1980s the community consisted of a scattered farm population 
1 CONT and a grain elevator, a branch of Barwise Elevator and Fertilizer, with 
1 CONT its office located in the old Allmon school building.

1 CONT JIM IN VIETNAM:
1 CONT 
1 CONT One of the saddest days of my life was when my son, James Allmon, flew o
1 CONC n Continental Airlines from San Francisco Airport to duty as a Marine i
1 CONC n Vietnam. My heart was sad and heavy, and continued to be so, until hi
1 CONC s return a year later.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Jim arrived in Vietnam during one of the fiercest battles – Marble Mount
1 CONC ain, at Danang. Little did I realize that they would drop him and othe
1 CONC r replacements there. With only six men left and the enemy climbing clos
1 CONC e to the top, the Leader phoned for help. The Air Force came in the nic
1 CONC k of time to ward off the Viet Cong and evacuate our boys.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Then Jim was made an MP (Military Police) for a while, checking ID’s o
1 CONC f the Vietnamese workers on the base. He became good friends with some
1 CONC , so it was especially hard to see them betray our men by exploding bomb
1 CONC s etc. that they carried on to the base. It was later learned that the V
1 CONC iet Cong had threatened to kill their families if they did not betray Am
1 CONC ericans as they were instructed.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Jim also was a helicopter maintenance man. If their helicopter was sho
1 CONC t down, Jim had to repair (and often fly) it as quickly as possible. Th
1 CONC e other men in the crew jumped out and formed a circle surrounding the h
1 CONC elicopter– “rifles at the ready.” Needless to say, Jim’s expertise and s
1 CONC wiftness made a great deal of difference as to whether they lived or die
1 CONC d by snipers, etc.
1 CONT 
1 CONT At night the men slept in groups in tents. On Mother’s Day, I awoke t
1 CONC o a vivid vision of my Jim on crutches, bandaged head, tattered clothe
1 CONC s and a sad look on his face. I knew something had happened to him but h
1 CONC ad no way a to find out. Finally, two weeks later I received a letter fr
1 CONC om him that said that on Mother’s Day his tent was blown up and his budd
1 CONC ies killed. Jim had just stepped out of the tent and was walking away wh
1 CONC en it happened and he was spared .Gratefully, I thanked God for protecti
1 CONC ng Jim.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Another thought comforted me also. After completing his training at Cam
1 CONC p LaJuene, Cherry Point, North Carolina, the Marines were given 30 day
1 CONC s leave before reporting for duty at Vietnam. Jim bought an old (vintage
1 CONC ) car with portholes for back windows – his pride and joy. He shared hi
1 CONC s drive home with two buddies coming this way also, and they shared th
1 CONC e driving.
1 CONT 
1 CONT In Kansas, about midnight, Jim was sleeping on the back seat of his car
1 CONC , and a hill approached. When they reached the top of the hill, a drun
1 CONC k was sitting in the middle of the road. An oncoming car swerved to avoi
1 CONC d the drunk and hit Jim’s car head-on, taking part of the left side of t
1 CONC he car, including part of the driver’s shoulder, and scattering broken g
1 CONC lass all over him and the passenger. Jim’s car veered into a tree. It wa
1 CONC s totaled. In the back seat Jim was thrown violently around and woke u
1 CONC p saying, “What’s happening to my car? What’s happening to my car?” The
1 CONC y were all taken to the hospital and Jim was released with no serious in
1 CONC juries. He caught the first Greyhound Bus to Oakland, CA and home! I fel
1 CONC t so sorry for Jim, but eternally grateful that he was”OK”.
1 CONT 
1 CONT After learning about Jim’s escape from death again in Vietnam, I remembe
1 CONC red the car incident and felt reassured that if God could bring Jim thro
1 CONC ugh that horrific car accident safely, that God could bring Jim home fro
1 CONC m Vietnam OK also!!! But my heart remained heavy until Jim walked throug
1 CONC h the door of our home from his tour of duty in Vietnam.

1 CONT 
1 CONT Thomas Allmon came to Marion County, Illinois from Tennessee, settled fi
1 CONC ve miles north of Salem. His wife was said to have been of Portuguese de
1 CONC scent. The story goes that the people at home in Tennessee received glow
1 CONC ing accounts of the fine country here in Illinois and the plentiful gam
1 CONC e which abounded but were skeptical of such reports. One old man said, "
1 CONC Well when Tommy writes back about the country we will get the truth." So
1 CONC on Tommy wrote telling how many deer could be seen grazing from the Hart
1 CONC land hill near where he had settled. But the old fellow shook his head a
1 CONC nd said, "Oh, he's just like all the rest now that he's moved out there.
1 CONC "
1 CONT 
1 CONT The story of Grandmother Allmon's nationality as remembered by her grand
1 CONC son, Michael Henry See, is that on one occasion when she told of her Por
1 CONC tuguese origin, a tipsy fellow over hearing the statement exclaimed, "
1 CONC A Ginni-gee by Gar." It is believed that she came from Pennsylvania, an
1 CONC d it is established that she spoke with an accent of some sort. She an
1 CONC d Thomas had a family of 15 children.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Grandfather brought a seedling peach with him from Tennessee. It was a l
1 CONC arge white cling, which became known as the Allmon peach. Later nurser
1 CONC y men tried to cross it with other varieties in order to get some colo
1 CONC r to it, but only succeeding in adding a faint pink, and we now know i
1 CONC t as the Heath Cling. Many people set out the peach, and Grandmother Jud
1 CONC y See had several trees, selling the fruit for as much as $3.00 a bushe
1 CONC l - not long after the Civil War - also getting the same price for a bus
1 CONC hel of black cherries.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Thomas Allmon had a horse mill where people brought corn to be ground. U
1 CONC ncle Thomas Smith of the Omega vicinity told of taking a grist to Allmon
1 CONC 's mill but was too late to get it ground that day, so many others wer
1 CONC e ahead of him. He had to stay overnight. The next morning early, Grandf
1 CONC ather called to the boys, "Hiram." "Yes, sir," responded Hiram instantly
1 CONC , and sprang out of bed, at once one after another, the other boys' fee
1 CONC t hit the floor; without a word all dressed and left for the barn and th
1 CONC e chores, and were seen no more until breakfast.
1 CONT 
1 CONT The family also had a lathe for wood turning and the boys made much of t
1 CONC heir furniture when they started their homes. Grandmother Allmon spent h
1 CONC er last years with her son, Jackson. One morning at breakfast as she wa
1 CONC s drinking a cup of coffee she was stricken with a stroke, but lived fo
1 CONC r a year, a bedridden invalid. Her daughter, Judith See, tried to driv
1 CONC e over to see her every month and Uncle Jack scarcely left the farm fo
1 CONC r any length of time during her long illness.

0 @N0149@ NOTE Death place likely to have been old Orange County formerly part o

1 CONC n Wake Co, NC in 1772/3(old Orange Co). Before Nathaniel, line was in Is
1 CONC le Of Wight County, VA.
1 CONT 
1 CONT According to the Almon Branch Book in possession of Hudson Alexander, fo
1 CONC ur of Nathaniel's brothers went to old Anson County (now Richmond). Seve
1 CONC ral got involved in the Regulator Movement, which ultimately became gene
1 CONC rally unpopular. Many involved left the area, some changing their names
1 CONC . There was a Matthew born 16 Jun 1782 in that area, the son of a John A
1 CONC lmond. One of Nathaniel's brothers was named John. Matthew moved to Indi
1 CONC ana and is progenitor to the Almonds in IN & IA. The book "ALMON BRANC
1 CONC H SEEKING NEW FRONTIERS" was self published by Eddie Almon Redmon-Hillia
1 CONC rd and has 664 pages.
0 @N0150@ NOTE John 'Richard' Almond (also recorded as Allman).Richard was one o
1 CONC f four Almond brothers that moved to what is now northwestern Stanly Co
1 CONC . NC between 1785 and 1790.Richard, after a short time, moved slightly w
1 CONC estward to what is now Cabarrus Co. His brother Thomas later moved to In
1 CONC diana or Illinois .Brothers Edward and Nathan remained in what was the
1 CONC n Montgomery Co. These four brothers were sons of Nathaniel Almond (b. a
1 CONC bt. 1730-32) and Alsey Comaday of old Orange Co. NC (now extreme NW Wak
1 CONC e Co.). It appears that Nathaniel of Orange (there were many Nathan Almo
1 CONC nds named after him) had several brothers that moved southwesterly to a
1 CONC n area just east of the Pee Dee River that is present day Richmond Co. (
1 CONC was Anson then).Brothers were William, James, Edward, and John. It appea
1 CONC rs that John was a Quaker.

1 CONT This section will have to be studied very carefully to determine the lin
1 CONC e of decent. The lineage in America has been proved back to Nicholas Bag
1 CONC gett II. The descent down from Nicholas II is marked with a number lef
1 CONC t of the colon. The number left of the colon shows the generation from N
1 CONC icholas Baggett II, who is number 1, down to the present  time. The numb
1 CONC er right of the colon designates the position of that child in that part
1 CONC icular family, beginning with the eldest as number 1. If you find your a
1 CONC ncestor anywhere in the genealogy section, trace it upwards to the neare
1 CONC st lowest number. If you recognize your ancestor, and he is beside 4:3 i
1 CONC t means that he is the fourth generation from Nicholas Baggett II (who i
1 CONC s 1:3), and the third child in that particular family. Remember, if he i
1 CONC s 4:3, as the example, go back to the first 3 left of the colon above it
1 CONC . That will be his or her parents.

1 CONT Brief Life History of Frances "Franky"
1 CONT When Frances "Franky" Stapler was born on 4 December 1783, in Georgia, U
1 CONC nited States, her father, Thomas William Stapler, was 44 and her mother
1 CONC , Ruth Ann Storey, was 33. She married Dempsey Rogers in Jackson, Georgi
1 CONC a, United States. They were the parents of at least 1 son and 2 daughter
1 CONC s. She died in 1845, in Tippah, Mississippi, United States, at the age o
1 CONC f 62.
1 CONT 
1 CONT April 15 1815, Dempsey took out a Runawway Brde ad to claim she left hi
1 CONC m for no reason, so obviously they had marital problems that did not qua
1 CONC lify for divorce.

1 CONT 
1 CONT Peter Shoop was a farmer who owned no property till after the civil war
1 CONC . Both wife Nancy and daughter Susanah Elizabeth were illiterate.
1 CONT 
1 CONT I am not sure as to what exactly Peter Shoop Sr.’s correct birth year is
1 CONC . I have 1811 but it may well be 1801. According to what census one use
1 CONC s both would be correct and 1811 is closer to Nancy’s age. The tombston
1 CONC e from what I have seen in person and from the scan that Lois sent me, i
1 CONC s really hard to read.
1 CONT 
1 CONT In the 1850 census Peter Shoop and family are in Huston Twp. Blair Count
1 CONC y. I took some entries from the 1860 census and tried to pin point his l
1 CONC ocation with a map I have from Bedford in 1860. I am almost certain tha
1 CONC t the family was then living just south of what today is named Queen i
1 CONC n Kimmel Township in Bedford County. The 1870 census lists Peter Sr. an
1 CONC d William as living next to one another. A map I have from around that t
1 CONC ime shows them living on what is today SR4030. This is about 2 miles fro
1 CONC m where the Shoop graves are. It is my interpretation of what info I hav
1 CONC e that when the 1860 census was taken the family rented a farm in the Qu
1 CONC een area. Peter Jr. married into a family that lived close by Pleasentvi
1 CONC lle in 1861. Peter’s father-in-law , Samuel Clark, was involved with a c
1 CONC hurch ( Methodist) in the Lovely area. William and Ellen Shoop married M
1 CONC ocks; David and Rebecca married Corl’s. I am pretty sure that William
1 CONC ’s and Ellen’s Mocks were brother and sister. Catherine also married a M
1 CONC ock but I can’t fit him in anywhere as yet. Not sure if David and Rebecc
1 CONC a’s spouses were related. Besides showing possible relationships, this m
1 CONC eans to me that by 1861 or so the family had moved to near the border o
1 CONC f St. Clair and Union Twps.

1 CONC e Court Daniel Horton a pensioner of the United States and for the purpo
1 CONC se of increasing his said pension to correspond with his servitude perfo
1 CONC rmed made & subscribed the following amendatory declaration to it that i
1 CONC n the war of the Revolution he resided in Burke County North Carolina an
1 CONC d there performed his military service, part of which he omitted to giv
1 CONC e in consequence of John Blair his attorney at the time informing him th
1 CONC at it was unnecessary to give any service not within the provisions of t
1 CONC he act of June 1832, and his impression at the time was that the service
1 CONC s hereinafter stated were not provided for. At the time declarant had hi
1 CONC s claim made out no construction had been given to the law and few if an
1 CONC y pensions had been allowed to any in this quarter – & for the reason af
1 CONC oresaid the service herein set forth was not then set forth in his decla
1 CONC ration though communicated to his attorney to it in the year 1780 he enr
1 CONC olled himself in Burke County North Carolina as one of the New Levies so
1 CONC -called under the act of North Carolina, and was put under Captain Joh
1 CONC n Russell, and the Overhill Indians in league with the British being i
1 CONC n open hostility & very many Tories also killing & plundering, Burke Cou
1 CONC nty being then a frontier County of the old settlements of North Carolin
1 CONC a the men there raised were sent through the upper parts of the State t
1 CONC o quill & keep in subjection the Tories & said Indians & did perform tha
1 CONC t duty by laborious services of forced marches by day & night travels fr
1 CONC om one quarter to another with the enemy appeared & was in several skirm
1 CONC ishes with the Indians & Tories & continued his term of service and wa
1 CONC s discharged verbally & returned home.
1 CONT That in addition to the service above left out of his original declarati
1 CONC on he in 1781 before the surrender of Cornwallis hired himself as a subs
1 CONC titute for one William Hawkins drafted to perform a tour of duty & wa
1 CONC s a substitute aforesaid placed under Captain Daniel Wright & Colonel Sm
1 CONC ith of General Greene's command and was marched from Burke where he enro
1 CONC lled to Wilmington in pursuit of Cornwallis went on his march through No
1 CONC rth Carolina & Virginia before his march to York Town, that the Britis
1 CONC h was fortified at Wilmington & there remained until his term of time o
1 CONC f three months expired & he was discharged by his said Captain, he omitt
1 CONC ed to state that this expedition was immediately after Greene's defeat a
1 CONC t Guilford, & the militia pursued the Army under Cornwallis down Deep Ri
1 CONC ver & Cape Fear [River] to Wilmington where he was discharged as aforesa
1 CONC id, which discharge he has lost. He gave both these tours into his attor
1 CONC ney Mr. Blair but he informed him that he could not get a pension for su
1 CONC bstitution, or for the twelve months there being no such call legally au
1 CONC thorized, but which declarant has since discovered was a mistake, he the
1 CONC refore claims and arrearage of pension for the aforesaid tours of duty t
1 CONC hus omitted. S/ Daniel Horton, X his mark

1 CONT - Lydia Wendling
1 CONT 20 Aug 1826 Alburtis, Lehigh, Pennsylvania, USA
1 CONT 
1 CONT ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1 CONT 
1 CONT The story below about the name-change is by Lucius Donkle Jr. and is sta
1 CONC ted as the family legend. Better genealogy has found Peter's parents t
1 CONC o be Danckel not Dunkel. The story below makes sense if you substitute "
1 CONC Danckel" for "Dunkel". FamilySearch.org shows Peter as the first of 11 c
1 CONC hildren of George Danckel (9 December 1769 - 3 April 1848, LJRH-YM7) bu
1 CONC t the only child with the last name of Donkle. All other children are li
1 CONC sted as Danckel's. If correct, the story below of Peter choosing to chan
1 CONC ge his name as the story describes makes sense, pending better evidence.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Another family legend is that everyone in the USA with spelling "Donkle
1 CONC " is related due to the unique source of that spelling. In support of th
1 CONC at hypothesis, the spelling "Donkle" does NOT appear in the US Census fo
1 CONC r 1800 or 1810 but first appears in the United States Census of 1820 a
1 CONC s Peter "Donkle" in Dauphin, Pennsylvania.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Source 2 - researched and recalled by Lucius Boardman Donkle Jr. circa 2
1 CONC 001 (Peter's great-grandson):
1 CONT In Pennsylvania Peter Donkle changed the family name from "Dunkel" (Dar
1 CONC k in German) to "Donkle". There was another "Dunkel" in town who used fo
1 CONC ul language, drank excessively, and was suspected of murder. Occasionall
1 CONC y , he got his mail mixed up with Peter's. Peter, a very pious man, want
1 CONC ed to disassociate himself as completely as possible from this evil Dunk
1 CONC el. So, he changed his name. On Peter's tomb stone in the cemetery in Ve
1 CONC rona, WI, it is spelled "Donkel". Peter's daughter-in-law, Martha Jane W
1 CONC hite Donkle, spoke often of the tombstone cutter's mistake and planned t
1 CONC o have it corrected, but never got around to it. The tombstones of his s
1 CONC ons, Edward, Henry, and William, are all spelled Donkle.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Peter and his wife, Lydia, originally came from Wilkes-Bare, PA., accord
1 CONC ing to family recollection. However, the "History of Verona" , publishe
1 CONC d as a centennial souvenir, says they came from Mercer County, PA. But
1 CONC , there is no record of their having been there.
1 CONT 
1 CONT The family came to Verona in a covered wagon in about 1835. At night the
1 CONC y camped and let the boys run about to use up energy, a relief after the
1 CONC ir being cramped in the wagon all day. After a few weeks, they arrived i
1 CONC n Verona where they built a one room log cabin, homesteaded land on Badg
1 CONC er Prairie, and started a new life. Their son Henry Donkle was only a ba
1 CONC by at the time. in addition to their three sons, they had five daughters
1 CONC .
1 CONT 
1 CONT Note: In June 2001, Lucius B. Donkle Jr. visited the Luzerne County Hist
1 CONC orical Society in Wilkes-Bare to see if any "Dunkel" birth or marriage r
1 CONC ecords could be found. A quick scan of microfilms for the 1830 census co
1 CONC vering Wilkes-Bare and the counties near it did not show any 'Dunkel's
1 CONC " or "Donkle's". However, the 1800 Pennsylvania Census did show severa
1 CONC l "Dunkle's" and "Wendling's" in the counties near Lancaster, PA. Lydi
1 CONC a Wendling was Peter Donkle's wife. So, it is possible, with a misspelli
1 CONC ng of "Dunkel", that this is the area where they met and married.
1 CONT 
1 CONT The Pennsylvania Census from 1800 to 1840 showed the following:
1 CONT 1800 - 0 Dunkel 12 - Dunkle
1 CONT 1810 - 2 Dunkel 22 - Dunkle
1 CONT 1820 - 0 Dunkel 27 - Dunkle
1 CONT 1830 - 10 Dunkel 35 - Dunkle
1 CONT 1840 - 8 Dunkel 47 - Dunkle
1 CONT The book " Pennsylvania German Immigrants 1709-1786" ( Published by Gene
1 CONC alogical Publishing Co. ) says
1 CONT 122 Germanic families emigrated in the period 1734-1752 from the Swiss C
1 CONC anton of Schaffhausen from Northcentral Switzerland, at the Falls of th
1 CONC e Rhine. Included were:
1 CONT Dunkel, Hans - village of Merishausen (1748) - To Pennsylvania with wif
1 CONC e and two sons.
1 CONT Dunkel, Melchoior - Village of Merishausen (1742) - To Pennsylvania wit
1 CONC h wife and children.
1 CONT Dunkel, Barbara - Village of Merishausen (1742) - To Pennsylvania
1 CONT 
1 CONT "in many cases names which do not appear in the emigrant lists turn up i
1 CONC n the registers of the Reformed Churches of Eastern Pennsylvania, as fo
1 CONC r instance the Bingolf, Demuth and DUNKEL families, which appear in th
1 CONC e records of the First Reformed Church, Lancaster, PA."
1 CONT 
1 CONT Unfortunately, at the time of writing this, nothing conclusive can be sa
1 CONC id as to where the Donkle's actually came from. But, speculation can eas
1 CONC ily lead to Switzerland and the area around Lancaster, PA.

1 CONT Notes for EMMETT MAYNARD ALLMON:
1 CONT 
1 CONT From Phillip Allmon, grandson, Nov. 15, 2000:
1 CONT 
1 CONT "Emmett left Texas as a young man, courted and married Edith Knutson i
1 CONC n California, settled in the fertile but sparsely populated San Joaqui
1 CONC n Valley between Fresno and Visalia, CA. They owned a "four corners" gro
1 CONC cery store and gas pump situated diagonal on one corner, with nothing el
1 CONC se visible for miles in any direction. Their first child was my Aunt Fra
1 CONC ncine (still alive in Fresno), then Uncle Maynard (alive in Virginia), a
1 CONC nd my dad Warren (d. 1965). Although I knew Emmett as an old man, earlie
1 CONC r photos of him show he was an exceedingly handsome man. After he died
1 CONC , he was cremated and I believe his ashes were returned to Texas, so h
1 CONC e may very well be buried in the Allmon cemetery. From time to time he w
1 CONC ould drive out to Texas to visit the surviving Allmon clan but didn't sa
1 CONC y very much about his experiences. He was definitely a Texan - a man o
1 CONC f few words."

1 CONT Thomas Allman Family History 1819 By Thomas M. Allman, et al
1 CONT 
1 CONT Thomas Allman was born in a town noted for its potteries which explain
1 CONC s why the town was known as Hanley, (commonly misspelled in Provo as Han
1 CONC dley), Staffordshire Potteries, England. Thomas lived there with his fat
1 CONC her, John Allman, and his mother Catherine Mollart Allman, his brothers
1 CONC , John William and four sisters, Mary, Sarah, Elizabeth and Dianah (or D
1 CONC inah). Thomas Allman was born 30 May 1819 and his sister, Mary 1818.
1 CONT 
1 CONT John Allman was a brick mason by trade and all his sons were brick mason
1 CONC s with the exception of Thomas who was a cabinetmaker. Thomas had learne
1 CONC d this trade by serving as an apprentice to William Hawkins of Hanley, S
1 CONC taffordshire, England for seven years. After serving his time he receive
1 CONC d his indenture papers as a cabinetmaker. John Allman was born about 178
1 CONC 0 in Shropshire, England, and his wife, Catherrine Mollart was born abou
1 CONC t 1789 in Burslem, Staffordshire, England. John was 60 years old when h
1 CONC e died on the 14 of February 1841. Catherine was 76 years when she die
1 CONC d the 11 February at her residence in Burslem at 5 Bond Street. Bursle
1 CONC m is a small city on the edge of Hanley.
1 CONT 
1 CONT When Thomas was 20 years old he fell in love and married his first wife
1 CONC , Prudence Mills., about 1839. Prudence Mills was born about 1821. The
1 CONC y had one child named John born 1840 in Hanley. Thomas and his wife join
1 CONC ed the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in 1841. In October 1
1 CONC 842 they desired to join the saints in America so they left Hanley for A
1 CONC merica and arrived seven weeks later in New Orleans, Louisiana after tra
1 CONC veling on a ship across the Atlantic Ocean. They left immediately for St
1 CONC . Louis, Missouri, where they had to spend the winter because the Missis
1 CONC sippi River was frozen. About the middle of April they left St. Louis o
1 CONC n the steamboat “Maid of Iowa” for Nauvoo, Illinois, traveling up the Mi
1 CONC ssissippi and arriving there the same spring.
1 CONT 
1 CONT On 31 May 1843 their second son, Reuben, was born. They were both very h
1 CONC appy with this event but Thomas came home from work one day to find tha
1 CONC t Prudence had passed away with her baby on her arm. She was only 20 yea
1 CONC rs old the 25 September 1843. Now he was a widower with two small childr
1 CONC en, and he was grief-stricken. However, the saints in Nauvoo were unite
1 CONC d and helped each other in time of trouble, so President Smoots' first w
1 CONC ife, Ma Smoot, took charge of the two small boys. The baby, Reuben, die
1 CONC d a few months later in 1844, and John, a young boy of six died later i
1 CONC n 1846.
1 CONT 
1 CONT On 5 October 1844 Thomas married a widow name Jane Walker Brull, and Eng
1 CONC lish convert who had nursed him through an illness. Apostle Willard Rich
1 CONC ards (ordained by Brigham Young 14 April 1840, performed the ceremony i
1 CONC n Nauvoo January. She was born in Worthington, Staffodshire, England, 1
1 CONC 2 March 1815. She joined the church and was baptized in October 1843. Sh
1 CONC e married her first husband, John Brull in October 1843 and left Englan
1 CONC d for America the same month. They arrived in Nauvoo 15 April 1844 wher
1 CONC e her husband died shortly thereafter. She was an eyewitness to the ligh
1 CONC t which shown over the Nauvoo Temple at the time it was dedicated. The c
1 CONC ornerstones of the temple were laid 6 April 1841, and it was publicly de
1 CONC dicated 30 April 1846. The baptismal font of the Nauvoo Temple was dedic
1 CONC ated 8 November 1841 by the Prophet Joseph Smith. It was a marble basi
1 CONC n upheld by marble oxen and was in use 4 years before the completion o
1 CONC f the Temple. Temple records show the endowments for the living were per
1 CONC formed from 10 December 1845 to 7 February 1845,
1 CONT 
1 CONT Thomas and Jane entered the Nauvoo Temple and received their endowment
1 CONC s 30 January 1846. They were living in Nauvoo when the Prophet Joseph Sm
1 CONC ith and Hyrum were assassinated and endured much suffering along with th
1 CONC e other saints. Thomas assisted in the building of the Nauvoo Temple an
1 CONC d did some work for the Prophet Joseph Smith. He built some carriages fo
1 CONC r the saints to use in crossing the plains. He built the carriage that s
1 CONC ister Hyrum Smith crossed the plains. He worked all winter and spring o
1 CONC f 1845 and 1846 making wagons for the pioneers of 1847 and all he receiv
1 CONC ed as pay was the running gears of a wagon without any iron on it whic
1 CONC h he sold for fifteen dollars.
1 CONT 
1 CONT During the winter Jane went to St. Louis and worked to be able to get so
1 CONC me groceries for them to live on. On the advice of Brother Joseph Youn
1 CONC g and others he went to Galena, Illinois, so he could get work and be ab
1 CONC le to get a wagon to travel to the valley. He got a job in a cabinet sho
1 CONC p and in a very short time he was promoted to foreman of the shop. He ha
1 CONC d made a beautiful piece of furniture which no other man in the shop wan
1 CONC ted to attempt to make. Townsend and Bash were the owners of the shop an
1 CONC d he discharged his son-in-law and gave Thomas the job of foreman. Ther
1 CONC e were 36 men working in the shop at the time. He held the position fo
1 CONC r 4 years and the owner offered to take him in as equal partner if he wo
1 CONC uld stay with them.
1 CONT 
1 CONT He declined this offer as he had left his native land for the gospel’s s
1 CONC ake and he had made up his mind to go to the valley and he would not sta
1 CONC y under any circumstances. He had a strong belief in the gospel of Jesu
1 CONC s Christ. During this time he had saved enough money to purchase a yok
1 CONC e of cattle and a yoke of cows, a wagon and the necessary things for th
1 CONC e trip across the plains. While living in Galena in the fall of 1846 th
1 CONC e cruel mob from Carthage came to Nauvoo where Jane was living and order
1 CONC ed her to cross the Mississippi River to Montrose where she would be saf
1 CONC e. She said to one of the mob, “If you will buy my cows and chickens I w
1 CONC ill go.” The man declined and told her “We will burn and mob all who d
1 CONC o not go.” She had no choice so Thomas sent her money to come to Galen
1 CONC a and she took her cows and chickens and an orphan boy she had taken t
1 CONC o raise. They lived there for 4 years.
1 CONT 
1 CONT On 22 April 1850 they left Galena in a wagon for Council Bluffs a distan
1 CONC ce of 600 miles. They had with them a yoke of cattle and a yoke of cows
1 CONC . They stayed there for one week before starting their journey across th
1 CONC e plains. They started their journey with the Aaron Johnson Company. Thi
1 CONC s company was divided into groups of 50 and 10 with Matthew Caldwell i
1 CONC n charge of their fifty and Thomas was made Captain of one of the group
1 CONC s of 10. They arrived in Salt Lake City on 9 October 1850, traveling fo
1 CONC r over 5 months. They lived there until 1856 where their daughter, Emm
1 CONC a Jane, was born 18 October 1853. He built himself a home in the Sixth W
1 CONC ard and was employed by the Public Works for several years. He worked o
1 CONC n the Salt Lake Tabernacle, the Beehive House, and the Lion House. He wo
1 CONC rked as a night watchman and policeman for 3 years. After the grasshoppe
1 CONC r war or famine, which was such a time of suffering for the saints, the
1 CONC y were all advised to raise their own wheat.
1 CONT 
1 CONT On 10 October 1856 he and his family moved to American Fork. He purchase
1 CONC d 110 acres of land and built a home. He put down the first well outsid
1 CONC e of the Fort in American Fork. He farmed 97 acres of the land and 13 ac
1 CONC res of hay. Thomas was called by Brigham Young to build the Meeting Hous
1 CONC e in American Fork. He worked on this and on the day the building was de
1 CONC dicated President Young called him to go to Provo to superintend the bui
1 CONC lding of the Meeting House there. In 1861 he moved to Provo. While livin
1 CONC g in American Fork he met Elmira Phillips who family had traveled from T
1 CONC oms River, Ocean County, New Jersey and arrived in Salt Lake City on 1
1 CONC 3 September 1861. Her father Richard Phillips and her mother Margaret Lu
1 CONC ker had a farm in American Fork. She was a very pretty young lady with b
1 CONC lue eyes and a profusion of nut brown hair, which she wore in ringlets
1 CONC , and Thomas immediately fell in love with this fair maiden. Thomas prop
1 CONC osed to her one night and of course he already had a wife, Jane and a da
1 CONC ughter Emma.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Since he was also 19 years older than she, Elmira couldn’t make up her m
1 CONC ind whether to accept the proposal or not. That night after retiring a w
1 CONC oman appeared and stood at the foot of her bed. She told her that she wa
1 CONC s to marry Thomas Allman as her mission in life was to be the mother o
1 CONC f his children. When she awoke the next morning she told Thomas she woul
1 CONC d marry him and of her experience of the night before. Thomas questione
1 CONC d her about the woman who had appeared to her and she described the woma
1 CONC n, Prudence Mills to him in detail. You have described her perfectly. (T
1 CONC his experience was related by Edwin Rusk Simons who heard his mother Mar
1 CONC y Ann Allman speak of it.)
1 CONT 
1 CONT Elmira did marry Thomas in the Endowment House in Salt Lake City on 21 F
1 CONC ebruary 1863 and had 11 children born unto them, 7 girls and 4 boys. Whi
1 CONC le in Provo Thomas superintended the building of the Meeting House or Ta
1 CONC bernacle he had charge of the building of the Provo Factory Building. Th
1 CONC e Provo Tabernacle was designed by Truman O. Angel, the same architect w
1 CONC ho designed the Salt Lake and St. George Temples. It was considered to b
1 CONC e one of the best meeting houses in the territory at that time.
1 CONT The pulpit was a wonderful piece of woodwork. The design itself was take
1 CONC n from a pulpit that President Brigham Young had seen in England. It wa
1 CONC s beautifully designed and the workmanship was so artistically done tha
1 CONC t it was truly a work of art. The entire building was beautifully done
1 CONC . The trusses in the roof were put together with hardwood pins and the t
1 CONC ower 80 ft. high had a 600 hundred pound bell which swung in it. Notwith
1 CONC standing the many years it stood, it was almost impossible to take it ap
1 CONC art. The Tabernacle was able to seat 1,300 people and answered their nee
1 CONC ds until 1883 when it was necessary to build a larger one.
1 CONT 
1 CONT The old meeting house was torn down in the 1919. The beautiful designs o
1 CONC n the ceiling and pulpit were done by Thomas. While in Provo he had char
1 CONC ge of a great deal of the carpenter work of the Provo Woolen Mills. He b
1 CONC uilt the first porch or veranda in Provo on President Brigham Young’s ho
1 CONC me which stood on the corner of 1st South and University. Emma Jane Allm
1 CONC an, the daughter, an only child of Thomas and Jane Walker Allman, his se
1 CONC cond wife, had her telegraph office in this building and was the first t
1 CONC elegraph operator in Provo. Jane Walker Allman, Emma’s mother, lived t
1 CONC o age of 88 years and died in Provo, Utah on 30 March 1903.
1 CONT 
1 CONT At one time someone suggested that Thomas Allman be sent on a mission fo
1 CONC r the church but Brigham Young said” “There is only one Allman in Utah a
1 CONC nd we need him here.” He lived in Provo from 1861 until 1876 when he wa
1 CONC s called by President Young to St. George to superintend the finishing (
1 CONC woodwork) of the St. George Temple. He returned to his home in Provo an
1 CONC d was called to Manti to work on the finishing of the temple there. He o
1 CONC beyed his call and left for Manti and built the altar’s woodwork and wor
1 CONC ked on the spiral staircase and did a great deal of the finest woodwor
1 CONC k in the temple. He was there about four years.
1 CONT 
1 CONT When he returned from Manti, he designed and built the framework for th
1 CONC e stand in the new Tabernacle in Provo. His health was very bad at thi
1 CONC s time having been stricken in June 1889 with gravel, a kidney trouble
1 CONC , from which he suffered a great deal. He died shortly thereafter on 2
1 CONC 2 July 1889 in Provo, Utah. His funeral services were held in the old ta
1 CONC bernacle which was largely attended and was buried in the Provo city cem
1 CONC etery.
1 CONT 
1 CONT He was First Counselor to Bishop J.P.R. Johnson of Provo First Ward f o
1 CONC r 26 years. Caroline Johnson served as President of the First Ward Relie
1 CONC f Society. Jane, Thomas’s second wife, and Mary Farrer served as First a
1 CONC nd Second Councilors. Jane, an excellent cook, kept boarders who were ac
1 CONC ademy students and many prominent citizens of the state such as” Willia
1 CONC m King, Joshua Greenwood and William Chipman of American Fork, Julian Gr
1 CONC iffin of Logan, James Paxman of Springville, and many others. Their daug
1 CONC hter, Emma, married Samuel Steven Jones a prominent citizen of Provo.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Elmira was the mother of 11 children and devoted most of her time to the
1 CONC m. Her avocation was nursing and she had great faith. She helped other
1 CONC s in throes of sickness and distress, even nursing one man back to healt
1 CONC h who had diphtheria. Thomas was often called upon to go out and adminis
1 CONC ter. Elmira had great faith—she always said the Lord would provide and H
1 CONC e did. Thomas worked hard carving and working in the Manti Temple, and a
1 CONC lthough an expert workman, he received only $5.00 a day. An ordinary car
1 CONC penter received from $2.00 to $5.00 per day.
1 CONT 
1 CONT At this time there were several small children in the family and they ne
1 CONC eded a cow. Thomas had inquired and had not succeeded in finding one fo
1 CONC r sale. Elmira prayed about it and then one morning she saw a cow lyin
1 CONC g near their gate and soon afterward a stranger came along. She inquire
1 CONC d about the cow and told of their needs and although reluctant to sell
1 CONC , he finally decided to do so and they got a good cow at a bargain.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Elmira’s home was built just 4 blocks east of the old one, a red brick h
1 CONC ouse with a large porch in front. She loved flowers and when the roses w
1 CONC ere in full bloom they formed a half circle around the lawn in front an
1 CONC d were very lovely. She had a comfortable home with a nice garden and fe
1 CONC w chickens. While living in Provo Thomas was appointed Captain of the se
1 CONC ttlement that sent men to meet Johnson’s army in Echo Canyon. Accordin
1 CONC g to his son Thomas Mollart Allman he was one of the most sincere Latter
1 CONC -day-Saints he had ever known. He is quoted as saying that his father Th
1 CONC omas took the last $10.00 he had up to the tithing office and paid it o
1 CONC n his tithing.
1 CONT 
1 CONT The following incidents were quoted by his son, Thomas M. Allman, was wo
1 CONC rking on a house in Manti, the architect and the owner were there and Jo
1 CONC seph Judd was also present to superintend the work and see that it was p
1 CONC roperly done. Joseph when introducing Thomas Mollart Allman, “He worke
1 CONC d for me on the Garfield Resort on Salt Lake, when he was a young man
1 CONC . I haven’t seen him since but I want to say to you, that I must thank t
1 CONC his man’s father (Thomas Allman) for what I know about woodwork. I worke
1 CONC d under him on the St. George Temple, and I am satisfied this man can d
1 CONC o the work, as his father was the best mechanic that ever graced the wes
1 CONC t.” Joseph Judd is the man that was in charge of the building of the “Sa
1 CONC lt Air Resort” on the Great Salt Lake.
1 CONT 
1 CONT In another incident an architect from New York was passing through Prov
1 CONC o saw the old meeting house and was so strongly impressed by it that h
1 CONC e went through the building. He remarked about the splendid condition o
1 CONC f the building after so many years of service of the splendid walls, an
1 CONC d the construction of the roof, tower, gallery, etc., and when he saw th
1 CONC e pulpit he said, “Well, there is one of the finest pieces of woodwor
1 CONC k I have ever seen. The splendid workmanship, the designs, and the artis
1 CONC tic manner in which this work was done is marvelous!” When he came throu
1 CONC gh Provo again, this beautiful building was torn down and destroyed. H
1 CONC e remarked, “What a shame it is that these old landmarks could not be pr
1 CONC eserved to house the relics of the pioneers."
1 CONT 
1 CONT Elmira Phillips and Thomas had the following children born to them: Mar
1 CONC y Ann born 26 Jun 1864, Prudella born 12 December 1865, Thomas Mollart b
1 CONC orn 4 April 1867, Levi William born 16 April 1869, Clara Valate born 5 M

1 CONC est grew to manhood and womanhood. All of these children were born in Pr

1 CONT Gregg is the younger son of Willis Turner Allman and Geraldine Alice (ne
1 CONC e Robbins) . He was born in Nashville Tennessee, thirteen months after h
1 CONC is brother Duane. His father was in the army and in 1949 the family relo
1 CONC cated to Fort Story, Norfolk, Virginia. Shortly after, his father was mu
1 CONC rdered by a casual acquaintance and Geraldine 'Mama A' Allman was left t
1 CONC o raise the boys. In order to retrain as an accountant, she sent her son
1 CONC s to Castle Heights Military Academy in Lebanon, Tennessee, which they b
1 CONC oth loathed. Eventually, in 1957, when his mother had finished her cours
1 CONC e, the family settled in Daytona Beach, Florida, and the boys attended S
1 CONC eabreeze High School.

1 CONT Both Duane and Gregg became captivated by music at a young age; Gregg ha
1 CONC s revealed that Duane and he went to see Jackie Wilson, Otis Redding, Pa
1 CONC tti Labelle and B.B. King perform and that he was particularly struck b
1 CONC y B.B.’s Hammond organ player. Gregg took an interest in the guitar befo
1 CONC re Duane did, learning the very basics from his grandmother’s neighbou
1 CONC r in Nashville. Duane would soon become the superior guitarist, giving u
1 CONC p school in tenth grade to focus on it while Gregg practiced his vocal
1 CONC s and keyboards, remained at school and finally graduated in 1965. Altho
1 CONC ugh he planned to become a dentist, Gregg fell in with his brother’s pla
1 CONC ns that they should become musicians, intending to go to medical schoo
1 CONC l after a short while; it didn’t happen.

1 CONC harine Harsell Rich, 72 Terrace Rd, Walnut C reek, CA 94596: Joseph Rich
1 CONC , Sr. was a staunch Quaker to his death in 1757.  Onl y a hundred year
1 CONC s earlier, in 1654 in England, George Fox, with no inten t to create a n
1 CONC ew religion but merely to reform the existing one, ha d a revalation whi
1 CONC ch was the initial substance of Quakerism.  In th e beginning the Common
1 CONC wealth authorities considered the many convert s "puritan" as opposed t
1 CONC o "royalist" because both puritan and Quake r had aspects in common
1 CONC :  a passion for righteousness, a moral earnes tness, a stand against "n
1 CONC atural" pleasures and enjoyments of "the wor ld," opposition to fashion
1 CONC s and customs (which might foster loosenes s of life or personal pride o
1 CONC r selfishness), their conception of soci al proprieties.  Therefore, und
1 CONC er the Commonwealth, Quakerism had a c hance to get started; James Naylo
1 CONC r and Edward Burroughs and others wi th Fox were highly successful in th
1 CONC eir missionary labors.  But withi n a matter of six years, the same "pur
1 CONC itan" characteristics brought p uritan and Quaker into conflict.  Then b
1 CONC oth were persecuted when th e monarchy was restored.  Sometimes during t
1 CONC hat late 17th century o f persecutions, Joseph Rich was born and becam
1 CONC e a Quaker. Characteristic of Quakers from their beginning until 1730-
1 CONC 7 whe n a formal organization of the Society of Friends was made (with a
1 CONC n increasing organizational discipline and rigidity of thought) was inde
1 CONC pendence o f thought, as well as responsibility for personal action an
1 CONC d directio n by conscience. Thus JOSEPH RICH Sr. was a religious rebel
1 CONC , in tha t he maintained his right of individual direction and responsib
1 CONC ility. Perhaps when all is told, the commitment to individual convicti
1 CONC o n and the courage to act on that conviction are dominant Rich characte
1 CONC risti cs . These are evident over a much longer period of time in the hi
1 CONC stori c growth of the middle class to which the Rich family belongs.  Th
1 CONC e R iches and the families with whom they intermarried have been goers a

0 @N0437@ NOTE MICHAEL HENRY SEE V (1856-194O), SON OF HENRY SEE
1 CONT 
1 CONT Michael Henry See V was born in Marion County, Illinois, Omega Township
1 CONC , October 15, 1856, son of Henry and Judith Allmon See and grew to manho
1 CONC od in the same locality. At an early age he was converted and affiliate
1 CONC d with the Southern Methodist Church at Old Camp Ground where he faithfu
1 CONC lly served in various capacities.
1 CONT 
1 CONT In 1877 he was united in marriage with Sarah Ann Craig (1855-1889), daug
1 CONC hter of James (known as Uncle Jim) and Catherine Wilkinson Craig. They w
1 CONC ere the parents of five children: Myrtle (1880) who died at the age of t
1 CONC hree months, twin infants who died shortly after birth April 7, 1878, El
1 CONC lis Leroy, November 21, 1881 and Otis Elroy, July 2, 1883. Sarah Ann die
1 CONC d February 16, 1889 and is buried in Cockrell Cemetery southeast of Kinm
1 CONC undy, Illinois.
1 CONT 
1 CONT On October 23, 1891 Michael married Alice Harrell (1873-1944), daughte
1 CONC r of William James and Pachel Pless Harrell. In her autobiography Alic
1 CONC e indicates that her ancestors were English and Pennsylvania Dutch and t
1 CONC hat in her very early years she and her father had a very close, lovin
1 CONC g relationship. She states that "no one could see the shadow that hung o
1 CONC ver our house. The summer I was four years old my mother died, leaving m
1 CONC y sister, ten years old, my brother, two years old and I, too young to r
1 CONC ealize our great loss; but there was a great change soon evidenced in th
1 CONC e home . . . in less than a year a stepmother came to rule our home." Sh
1 CONC e states that her father went with her and Michael to the minister's hou
1 CONC se for the marriage ceremony.
1 CONT 
1 CONT According to Alice, Michael was patient, not quick to criticize, and sim
1 CONC ple in his manner of living. Money was never plentiful with the living c
1 CONC oming off the farm and occasionally he got some carpentering to do. He w
1 CONC as painstaking and conscientious in whatever work he engaged.
1 CONT 
1 CONT They were the parents of seven children: Irene Melba (1892), Eunice Velm
1 CONC a (1894), Hobart Harrell (1896), Edith Fern (1897), Winifred Elma (1900)
1 CONC , and twins Charlene and Georgia (1902). Georgia died at eight months o
1 CONC f age. They lived in a house near Michael's boyhood home until around 19
1 CONC 04 when Michael built a two story house on the land he had inherited fro
1 CONC m his parents. Alice often read to the children and a high priority wit
1 CONC h Michael and Alice was an education for their children.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Edith Fern See recalls that when she was a young child Uncle Jim Craig (
1 CONC Sarah Ann Craig See's father) would come to their house often and her mo
1 CONC ther, father and Uncle Jim would sit around and talk. One story Edith re
1 CONC members is a tale told by Uncle Jim. The Craig family came to Illinois f
1 CONC rom Kentucky when Jim was a young boy and the family traveled with the L
1 CONC incoln family; Nancy Hanks Lincoln was a relative of the Craigs. As the
1 CONC y came overland one mule was to be used by Jim and Abe Lincoln. Accordin
1 CONC g to the story Jim had to walk the distance as Abe would not share! Th
1 CONC e Craigs settled in Marion County and the Lincoln's went on north.
1 CONT 
1 CONT When Irene and Eunice were in high school they would room in the home o
1 CONC f a Kinmundy resident and then Michael and Alice would pay the room ren
1 CONC t with eggs, potatoes, beans and other garden items. The family had a te
1 CONC am of horses, Mae and Maude. Edith Fern tells the story that one time Ir
1 CONC ene stayed overnight with a friend in Kinmundy. The mother told Edith t
1 CONC o drive Mae to town but park the buggy at the Methodist Church on the hi
1 CONC ll and walk down-town and get Irene. She did not want Edith to cross th
1 CONC e railroad track with Mae and the buggy. Edith says she was nine years o
1 CONC ld at the time.
1 CONT 
1 CONT In 1912 Michael had the misfortune of having the scaffolding under him b
1 CONC reak while at work on the old Baptist Church in the southwest part of Ki
1 CONC nmundy. The fall injured his back and finally caused him to lose his eye
1 CONC sight. Around 1914 the family moved to Kinmundy and Michael transferre
1 CONC d his church membership to the Kinmundy Southern Methodist Church and wh
1 CONC en it terminated to the Methodist Episcopal Church. With this handicap h
1 CONC e was still able to make his own way about the streets of town and coul
1 CONC d find any business house in Kinmundy. For many years he made two dail
1 CONC y trips to the business district to get the mail and visit with the loca
1 CONC l gentlemen. During the winter months when walking was restricted by th
1 CONC e weather Alice would read the Bible, newspaper and books to Michael.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Hobart Harrell began preaching at the age of 18 and the writings of Alic
1 CONC e in her autobiography indicate that when our country entered the Worl
1 CONC d War Hobart "felt it his duty to God and as a patriot to volunteer." H
1 CONC e reported October 3, 1917 to Camp Grant and in May 1918 was sent to th
1 CONC e front lines. He fell in action August 8, 1918 by machine gun fire bein
1 CONC g one to answer a call for volunteers to wipe out a machine gun nest. H
1 CONC e died near Fismes, France. In 1931 Alice Harrell See was one of the man
1 CONC y Gold Star Mothers to travel to France to visit the grave of fallen son
1 CONC s.
1 CONT 
1 CONT In 1933 Buster, a brown and white fox terrier who was the pet of the chi
1 CONC ldren of Charlene See Miller, came to Kinmundy to live after her death
1 CONC . He became the constant companion of Michael See and made the daily tri
1 CONC ps to town. The man and his dog were inseparable.
1 CONT 
1 CONT In 1939 the big two story white house with two large porches burned an
1 CONC d many family treasures were lost. Michael and Alice moved into a hous

1 CONT Prepared by Irene See Brasel for Kinmundy Centennial Booklet
1 CONT 
1 CONT Issued by Kinmundy Woman's Club, 1957
1 CONT 
1 CONT Mrs. Nancy Greenlee See came to Kinmundy Township in 1844 from Point Ple
1 CONC asant in Mason County Virginia (West Virginia since 1863). With her wer
1 CONC e two daughters, Jane, the eldest, and Elizabeth and her husband, Richar
1 CONC d Elred Shelton, and the three younger See boys. The widow of Michael Se
1 CONC e, Captain of the 106th Regular Virginia Militia of the War of 1812, sh
1 CONC e was left at thirty-three with nine children to rear; Shull Morris, Jan
1 CONC e, Elizabeth, Minerva, Frances, John, Henry, Michael and Frederick.
1 CONT 
1 CONT At an early age, Shull M. See began working on the Ohio River; later h
1 CONC e became a pilot for craft running to Cincinnati; John and Jane ran th
1 CONC e farm, and all the younger brothers, in time, worked on the river
1 CONC . . . "a-boating", as it was called.
1 CONT 
1 CONT In 1843, Stokes Prewett, his wife Minerva See and their four small child
1 CONC ren moved to Illinois, coming down the Ohio by flat boat to Shawneetown
1 CONC . He bought land, now belonging to J. W. McCulley and J. Hoyt, which joi
1 CONC ned that of his half-brother, Robert Pruett, whose house was just west o
1 CONC f the present Illinois Central Railroad reservoir. Minerva wrote her mot
1 CONC her of the fine land still available in the township at one dollar and t
1 CONC wenty-five cents an acre.
1 CONT 
1 CONT In March 1844, the family arrived and moved into a cabin northwest of Ev
1 CONC ergreen Cemetery rented from Harvey Gray and his mother, who had gone t
1 CONC o Tennessee to settle an estate. The boys farmed some of Robert Pruett'
1 CONC s land that first year. Their cornfield extended from the present Kinmun
1 CONC dy Methodist Church to a creek near the old Judge Snelling home. They, a
1 CONC lso, built a double-log cabin on their own land south of town . . . a ha
1 CONC lf-quarter mile from the Sheltons.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Shull M. See, his wife Mary Elizabeth Day and little son, Charles Michae
1 CONC l, followed the Prewetts' to Illinois. John See and young daughter, Susa
1 CONC n, came in 1846, soon after the death of his wife, Catherine Day. France
1 CONC s and Alexander Waugh were the last of the family to leave Mason County
1 CONC , settling near the others. After his wife's death, Alex Waugh moved wit
1 CONC h his children to Missouri. Mrs. Elsie Gee Alexander of Centralia is a g
1 CONC randdaughter.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Money in this new country was scarce and there was no way to earn any. M
1 CONC ichael and Frederick, in order to buy more land, decided to return to Vi
1 CONC rginia to work on the river. In mid-winter 1846, the two boys walked t
1 CONC o Odin in bitter weather to catch the stage for St. Louis to take a boa
1 CONC t for Pt. Pleasant. Michael returned after a year. Coming to Shawneetow
1 CONC n by boat, he walked the rest of the way home. His money in gold coins h
1 CONC ad worn through a thick leather wallet. Frederick remained in Virginia f
1 CONC or a number of years where he married Virginia Barnett. They moved wit
1 CONC h her people to Iowa. During the Civil War they joined the rest of the f
1 CONC amily in Marion County. Among their descendants here are: Mrs. Leona Se
1 CONC e Zimmer, Mrs. Edna See Telford, and Mrs. Hults Sipes.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Henry and Michael both married daughters of Thomas Allmon; this prominen
1 CONC t family of Tonti Township came from Tennessee in 1829. Henry's wife wa
1 CONC s Judith; Michael married the youngest, Elizabeth, who died at seventeen
1 CONC , leaving a son, Henry William See. In 1851 Michael married Nancy Jane C
1 CONC arrigan, daughter of Robert Mabane Carrigan, Marion County pioneer, an
1 CONC d brought her to the homestead, where their family has resided for mor
1 CONC e than one hundred years. The house built about 1860 is occupied by hi
1 CONC s youngest daughter, Miss Clara See and granddaughter, Mrs. Rhea White L
1 CONC owe.
1 CONT 
1 CONT John and Henry later took up land "across the prairie" in Omega Township
1 CONC . Here, Henry died in 1863 from an injury sustained while digging a well
1 CONC . He left four young sons; George, Michael Henry, Thomas W., and Charles
1 CONC . His surviving grandchildren are Otis E. See, Lewin W. See, Irene See B
1 CONC rasel, Eunice See Kettles, Edith See and Winifred See Lamwersiek.
1 CONT 
1 CONT John See married Mary J. French in 1851. She was the daughter of Peter F
1 CONC rench, the messenger from General Andrew Jackson to Sir Edward Packenha
1 CONC m at the battle of New Orleans. John See died in 1872 His land adjoinin
1 CONC g that of Henry has been in the family the past century. Paul See, Joh
1 CONC n S. See, and Mrs. Hazel See Millican of this area are children of a son
1 CONC , Shull See.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Jane See became the third wife of John Martin of Alma, Illinois. Her onl
1 CONC y child, Matilda, who married John Gibson, died of cholera in 1902, whil
1 CONC e accompanying her husband on a trip to the Philippines. Her daughter, J
1 CONC ane Gibson Philipps (Mrs. Frank) lives in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Shull M. See died in 1857. Of his nine children, three sons grew to manh
1 CONC ood, Charles Michael, Orcelas and George Robert. Miss Carrie See is a da
1 CONC ughter of Orcelas See. Mrs. Agnes Crooker Bee of Alma resides in the ol
1 CONC d homestead of her grandfather, Charles Michael See. The George Robert S
1 CONC ee family moved to Missouri a number of years ago.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Among the ten children of Stokes and Minerva Prewett were three doctors
1 CONC . Robert and Granville Prewett practiced medicine many years at Marshall
1 CONC , Illinois. Dr. L. D. Prewett and his parents are buried in Evergreen Ce
1 CONC metery.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Miss Minnie Parker, Arlington, Virginia, a former teacher in the Kinmund
1 CONC y school, is a granddaughter.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Elizabeth See and Richard Eldred Shelton built their home on land now kn
1 CONC own as the Broom Orchard south of Kinmundy. A childless couple, their ho
1 CONC me was also the home of a niece, Matilda Waugh Gee and a nephew, Henry W
1 CONC illiam See. Here Grandmother Nancy Greenlee See spend her last years. R
1 CONC . E. Shelton, stockman and land owner, died in l893, surviving his wif
1 CONC e by one year.
1 CONT 
1 CONT During the Civil War, the See family, as their origin suggests, was symp
1 CONC athetic to the South, but two grandsons, Charles Michael See, 40th Illin
1 CONC ois Volunteer Infantry and Vernal Prewett, 111th Illinois Volunteer Infa
1 CONC ntry, were with Sherman on his 'march to the sea." Vernal was captured a
1 CONC t the siege of Atlanta and spent nine months in Andersonville Prison. De
1 CONC cades later in World War I 1917, numerous great grandsons fought for the
1 CONC ir country, for which two, George Herman Anna and Hobart Harrell See mad
1 CONC e the "supreme sacrifice."
1 CONT 
1 CONT Nancy Greenlee See died in 1871 and is buried in Eastland Cemetery sout

1 CONT Note from Bridgie Pierce:
1 CONT 
1 CONT Grandmother Eliza Pierce raised Dan Pruitt's wife, Maude Houston (daught
1 CONC er of Thomas Houston and Mary Jane Allman), after her mother died. She w
1 CONC as not fond of Richard Burl (Dick) Pruitt when Maude started seeing hi
1 CONC m because she thought he drank too much. Once when he came to see Maude
1 CONC , Grandmother Eliza threw hot water on him. they were eventually marrie
1 CONC d anyway. Grandmother Pierce made really good light bread. Levi Pierce b
1 CONC uilt Wesley Newman's house. Grandmother Pierce stayed with them there.
1 CONT 
1 CONT From the Lawton Constitution, Sunday April 5, 1925, Mrs Eliza Pierce pas
1 CONC sed away Saturday morning as a result of burns.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Mrs Eliza Pierce of Faxon met with a horrible death when her dress caugh
1 CONC t fie from a stove whle she was burning paper Friday evening. Acording t
1 CONC o meager reports, Mrs. Pierce was burning paper in the burner when her c
1 CONC lothing in some manner caught fire and before assistance could reach her
1 CONC , her body was enveloped in flames, the flesh was practically cooked i
1 CONC n places, altho rs Pierce lived until seven o'clock Saturday morning. Mr
1 CONC s. Pierce had reached the ripe old age of 89 years, and for her to mee
1 CONC t such a tragic death at her age seems more than sad. A little boy is sa
1 CONC id to have been in the home with her. No detailed information could be o
1 CONC btained.
1 CONT 
1 CONT A. Pierce, a son of Cyril, Oklahoma, was passing through Lawton Saturda

1 CONT Samuel Almond and Mary Crockford
1 CONT (https://www.americantapestry.net/2020/07/31/builders-of-the-old-dominio
1 CONC n-3/)
1 CONT 
1 CONT GETTING TO VIRGINIA
1 CONT Despite the fact that many events in the life of Samuel Almond cannot b
1 CONC e documented, he was a real person who really did leave his home in Ches
1 CONC ham, England, to immigrate to Jamestown.  That much we know.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Chesham is only 11 miles from Aylesbury, where Thomas Harris and Adria H
1 CONC oare had lived, and also not far from London, where Christopher Branch a
1 CONC nd Mary Addie had lived. They were among many who left this area of Engl
1 CONC and in the first half of the 17th century to settle in Virginia. Samuel
1 CONC ’s name is usually seen in the documents as SAMUELL, and the surname i
1 CONC s sometimes seen as ALLMAND or D’ALMOND.
1 CONT 
1 CONT 
1 CONT 
1 CONT A review of my previous post, Builders of the Old Dominion 2, will hel
1 CONC p give context:   Christopher Branch and his wife Mary Addie had arrive
1 CONC d on the Marchant in 1620. By the time Christopher Branch’s children ha
1 CONC d grown up, Samuel Almond had arrived in Jamestown. This is estimated b
1 CONC y researcher Louise Ashby Almond to have been around 1635, when Henric
1 CONC o County was organized as one of the eight original shires of Virginia. 
1 CONT 
1 CONT Christopher Branch and Samuel Almond undoubtedly knew each other since t
1 CONC hey were land owners in the same county, but Christopher’s wife Mary ha
1 CONC d died by the time Samuel Almond arrived. Years later, Samuel’s daughter
1 CONC , Sarah Almond, married Christopher’s son, Christopher Branch, Jr.  Ther
1 CONC e is no documentation for this, unfortunately—only family tradition an
1 CONC d unverified notes. Sarah Almond and Christopher Branch Jr. were the par
1 CONC ents of Mary Branch, future grandmother of President Thomas Jefferson.
1 CONT 
1 CONT BECOMING A LAND OWNER
1 CONT Samuel’s three land transactions were made in 1637, 1638, and 1639. Immi
1 CONC gration records show his arrival in 1639, but that date refers to when h
1 CONC is land was patented or the record created—not when he actually arrived
1 CONC . This is explained in this reference from Ancestry.com:
1 CONT 
1 CONT [image on site]
1 CONT 
1 CONT The map which follows shows Samuel’s land in the extreme upper left corn
1 CONC er. It was just south of present day Richmond. The transactions are list
1 CONC ed in Cavaliers and Pioneers.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Arthur Bayly and Thomas Crosby received 800 acres in Henrico County in J
1 CONC anuary 1637. They assigned 400 acres of this patent to Samuell Almond.
1 CONT Thomas Crosby transferred another 400 acres to Samuell Almond in Februar
1 CONC y 1638.
1 CONT In March 1639, Samuell Almond received 600 more acres in Henrico County.
1 CONT 
1 CONT [image on site]
1 CONT 
1 CONT Almost all of the land owners grew tobacco, and, apparently, it was a ve
1 CONC ry involved process to get the tobacco ready for market. (Note: The illu
1 CONC stration more accurately portrays a much later time period.)
1 CONT 
1 CONT Whether Samuel had slaves or not, I do not know, but I doubt that he did
1 CONC . The first slaves arrived in 1619, but the Virginians had no intentio
1 CONC n of having slaves. Slavery was introduced when a Dutch ship captain, ru
1 CONC nning short of provisions, was trying to get the Africans off his ship
1 CONC . He landed at Jamestown and wanted the Virginians to buy them. The Virg
1 CONC inians did not want to do that, but they finally agreed to it when the c
1 CONC aptain threatened to throw the captives overboard. (Wallace)
1 CONT 
1 CONT Over time, more and more settlers had slaves, but it was a societal chan
1 CONC ge that evolved slowly from that first encounter, eventually creating su
1 CONC ffering and discord that has lasted to this day.
1 CONT 
1 CONT [image on site]
1 CONT 
1 CONT The tobacco growers had a system of verifying the quality of all the tob
1 CONC acco. Samuel was tasked with this responsibility in 1639, as explained i
1 CONC n the Virginia Magazine of History and Biography. It is apparent that h
1 CONC e had earned respect from his new neighbors after being in Henrico les
1 CONC s than five years.
1 CONT 
1 CONT STILL RESEARCHING THE ALMONDS
1 CONT I have seen some trees on Ancestry.com that provide more detailed inform
1 CONC ation about Samuel Almond; however, the sources included do not suppor
1 CONC t the conclusions. For example, you can’t use birth records to suppor
1 CONC t  a birth that occurred a century earlier. Obviously.
1 CONT 
1 CONT One contributor on Ancestry.com did provide some credible notes of Louis
1 CONC e Ashby Almond (1911-1990), who had received the genealogical records co
1 CONC mpleted by her uncle, Frank Hobson. Clearly, we have to use this informa
1 CONC tion cautiously since we have no other documentation. Louise stated tha
1 CONC t the Almond family originally lived in Alsace Lorraine, where resident
1 CONC s were under severe stress due to wars and religious persecution. The Al
1 CONC monds fled to England and settled in Chesham.
1 CONT 
1 CONT According to Louise’s notes, Samuel’s two children, Sarah and William, s
1 CONC urvived the well-documented Indian massacre of April 1644 by hiding i
1 CONC n a woodbox. Samuel, however, was among 500 other Virginians who were sl
1 CONC aughtered. No mention is made of Samuel’s wife or who cared for the chil
1 CONC dren after their father’s death.
1 CONT 
1 CONT The tradition is that Samuel’s wife was Mary Crockford. I have not yet b
1 CONC een able to verify that, but I have found some English wills in Sussex t
1 CONC hat mention Crockfords. Contributors to WikiTree have included a littl
1 CONC e more detail, providing the names  John Almond and Elizabeth Weldon a
1 CONC s Samuel’s parents, and  George Crockford and Anne Honna  as parents o
1 CONC f Mary. The WikiTree page says Samuel and Mary were married in Sussex, E
1 CONC ngland, in 1623.  I will update this post as more reliable information c
1 CONC omes to light.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Hopefully, someone will read this and offer information that helps verif
1 CONC y the wife and children of Samuel Almond, a resident of Henrico County f
1 CONC or less than 10 years before his decease. If you know more details, I wa
1 CONC nt to hear from you!

1 CONT Mr. and Mrs. Hamilton lived in Tarrant County, about four miles north o
1 CONC f Azle. Wm. Hamilton had gone to Springtown to mill, and Mrs. Hamilton a
1 CONC nd some of her children were at the home alone. Mrs. Hamilton was weavin
1 CONC g on an old-time loom at her log cabin home in the edge of the timber, w
1 CONC hen several Indians took them by surprise. Several of the children wer
1 CONC e away. Wm. Hamilton Jr. was attending cattle, Mahala, Eliza, Samuel an
1 CONC d John were picking cotton. Sarina Myres, a step-child of Mr. Hamilton
1 CONC , and Mary and Gus, the infant children of Mr. and Mrs. Hamilton, were a
1 CONC t home with their mother. Mrs. Hamilton was murdered and her baby partl
1 CONC y scalped, but it lived a short time. Sarina Myres, and Mary Hamilton, h
1 CONC alf-sisters, were made prisoners. Feather beds were ripped open and th
1 CONC e house robbed of its contents. After traveling thirty or forty miles, t
1 CONC he Indians camped that night somewhere in Wise County. Little Mary Hamil
1 CONC ton had been having chills, so they wrapped her up warmly, and left he
1 CONC r alone in camp the next morning when the Indians rode away. But she cri
1 CONC ed so unmercifully, a warrior returned and murdered the little girl. Sar

1 CONT 
1 CONT =====
1 CONT 
1 CONT According to further research by Doyle Marshall, from the book, A Cry Un
1 CONC heard, the story is as follows:
1 CONT 
1 CONT The party left immediately with the captives for their camp in Indian Te
1 CONC rritory. Unlike most raiding parties in North Texas who, after committin
1 CONC g depredations, rode rapidly and continuously until they reached sanctua
1 CONC ry north of the Red River, the Kiowa band camped that night in Texas. Ne
1 CONC xt morning, while breaking camp, the warriors became concerned at the si
1 CONC ght of dust rising from the back trail. Fearing that they were being pur
1 CONC sued by the settlers, the party quickly started for the Red River. To ex
1 CONC pedite his escape the captor of Mary Hamleton left her, wrapped in a bla
1 CONC nket, at the campsite. When they soon found that the dust was caused b
1 CONC y a herd of stampeding cattle, the Kiowas relaxed their pace. Mary's cap
1 CONC tor told Hah-bay-te that he had left the child behind and alive. Hah-bay
1 CONC -te thereupon recovered her, took her to the Kiowa camp, and gave her t
1 CONC o this childless daughter.
1 CONT 
1 CONT An-pay-kau-te recalled that when brought into the Kiowa village and take
1 CONC n from Hah-bay-te's horse, the little blue-eyed, light haired captive wa
1 CONC s very lively and ran around camp. She was a happy, good-natured child a
1 CONC nd quickly learned to play with the Indian girls. However, some, when ol
1 CONC d, recalled that she had a temper, and, when angry, could "whip them all
1 CONC ." She readily learned to speak Kiowa and soon forgot her native tongue.
1 CONT 
1 CONT At first, Mary Hamleton was called Ta-han, meaning Texan, the most commo
1 CONC n name given to captives from Texas. After her adjustment to the savag
1 CONC e way of life and her acceptance by the Kiowas she was given the name, T
1 CONC o-goam-gat-ty, meaning, "the woman who holds the medicine, standing in t
1 CONC he rear of the tipi." She was, however, affectionately called "To-goam."
1 CONC The two other captive children, Sarina and Gus, were sold at a militar
1 CONC y post. When United States government officials inquired about the "othe
1 CONC r" child taken in the raid on the Hamleton home, the Kiowas replied tha
1 CONC t she had died.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Soon after her capture, To-goam went with her captors to the celebrate
1 CONC d Council of Medicine Lodge Creek, in southern Kansas, where on Octobe
1 CONC r 21, 1867 a treaty was made between the Comanches, Kiowas, and Kiowa-Ap
1 CONC aches and the United States. Most of the Kiowas went solely for the purp
1 CONC ose of receiving government annuities. The Kiowas had a good time at th
1 CONC e council, although, due to the language barrier, they seemed to underst
1 CONC and little of what was said. Two things, however, they did understand; t
1 CONC hey would be placed on a reservation near the Wichita Mountains, and al
1 CONC l their white captives must be surrendered. To avoid having to give up t
1 CONC heir beloved To-goam her foster parents hid the child out on the prairie
1 CONC -a safe distance from the eyes of the soldiers, newspaper reports, and g
1 CONC overnment officials.
1 CONT 
1 CONT To-goam was reared in a respected Kiowa family by a loving foster mother
1 CONC , Tope-kau-da (Oak Tree, or Acorn) and foster father, a warrior named Ta
1 CONC n-goodle, who died a few years after To-goam was taken into their care
1 CONC . To-goam provided much pleasure and companionship to her widowed foste
1 CONC r mother. The two were seldom separated until the leading male member o
1 CONC f Tope-kau-da's family selected a Mexican captive as a husband for the g
1 CONC irl. After her marriage To-goam often lay in her tipi and cried for he
1 CONC r foster mother, while lonely Tope-kau-da wept for her "special" child.
1 CONT 
1 CONT As a strong, large-framed young woman, To-goam excelled in horsemanship
1 CONC . When thrown, while breaking mustangs, she would cheerfully try again u
1 CONC ntil she succeeded. She was an expert at training and caring for horses
1 CONC . To-goam also excelled at swimming. When a fine horse, which was tied t
1 CONC o a tree on a rise was threatened by rising floodwaters, none of the you
1 CONC ng Kiowa men were willing to risk their lives by swimming the rushing wa
1 CONC ters to rescue the animal. To-goam put a knife between her teeth, jumpe
1 CONC d into the floodwaters, swam to the rise, and cut the terrified horse lo
1 CONC ose. The men were humiliated by her bravery, but they greatly respecte
1 CONC d her for the daring rescue.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Although To-goam developed into an envied Kiowa of exceptional strength
1 CONC , ability, and determination, her Caucasian features served as a sourc
1 CONC e of distress and humiliation to her. She lived in constant fear that, b
1 CONC ecause of her Anglo appearance, she might be discovered and taken from h
1 CONC er Kiowa people. Tope-kau-da had taught her to look down when in the pre
1 CONC sence of white people so that her blue eyes could not be seen. Consequen
1 CONC tly, most whites who saw her thought that she was a shy little Indian gi
1 CONC rl. During the winter of 1874-75, when the Kiowas were compounded in th
1 CONC e stone corral at Fort Sill, Tope-kau-da kept To-goam from being recogni
1 CONC zed as a white by painting her hair green, her face red, and keeping he
1 CONC r skin covered with a shawl. When officials several years later discover
1 CONC ed that To-goam was a white captive, she was the wife of a Mexican capti
1 CONC ve and had children of her own. They wisely left her with her adopted pe
1 CONC ople.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Although brought up in the religion of the Kiowas, To-goam was converte
1 CONC d to Christianity when the Baptist mission was established at Rainy Moun
1 CONC tain. Thus, her religious affiliation became the same as that of many o
1 CONC f the settlers in the area from whence she had been taken many years bef
1 CONC ore.
1 CONT 
1 CONT To-goam lived all but five of her sixty-two years as a Kiowa. She did no
1 CONC t remember her life as Mary Hamleton nor where in Texas she had lived. U
1 CONC pon her death on July 22, 1924, she was buried alongside her adopted peo
1 CONC ple in the Rainy Mountain Baptist Mission Cemetery. She was survived b
1 CONC y seven children and their many descendants, who considered themselves K
1 CONC iowas, although their mother was an Anglo and their father was a Mexican

1 CONT Duncan man traces family to Kiowa raid
1 CONT Jim Etter
1 CONT 
1 CONT DUNCAN - More than 135 years after being seized as a child in an India
1 CONC n raid, To-goam has rejoined her white relatives in Duncan.
1 CONT 
1 CONT She has joined them in a figurative, posthumous sense that describes Gai
1 CONC l Davis' jarring discovery about his ancestors and a violent era of Texa
1 CONC s and Oklahoma history.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Davis, a retired oil company engineer and native of Duncan, recently lea
1 CONC rned that his great-great-aunt was spirited away by warriors in 1867 aft
1 CONC er they stormed her family's log cabin in northern Texas and killed he
1 CONC r mother.
1 CONT 
1 CONT He also found that she spent the rest of her life - happily, apparentl
1 CONC y - as a Kiowa tribal member in Indian Territory and Oklahoma, and neve
1 CONC r knew her real identity.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Davis, 63, began his family research about three years ago after retirin
1 CONC g from Halliburton Energy Services. He uncovered documents showing tha
1 CONC t his distant relative was the same Mary Hamleton whose life story is re
1 CONC corded in history.
1 CONT 
1 CONT The saga of Mary Hamleton, whose Kiowa name was To-goam-gatty (meaning "
1 CONC woman who stands behind the tipi" and shortened to To-goam), is one of a
1 CONC t least three well-publicized cases involving captured children during t
1 CONC he 1800s in the region of Texas and Indian Territory - an ironic bit o
1 CONC f tenderness in a bloody, barbaric conflict between American Indians an
1 CONC d settlers.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Davis wondered about a remark he had often heard from his aunt, the lat
1 CONC e Opal Hunt of Duncan: "Whatever happened to the two little girls in ou
1 CONC r family taken by the Indians?"
1 CONT 
1 CONT After months poring over stacks of reading material and interviewing sou
1 CONC rces in two states, Davis learned about the raid on the home of Willia
1 CONC m and Sara Hamleton - and found they were his distant relatives.
1 CONT 
1 CONT 
1 CONT According to reports, it was a pretty day in April when about 60 painte
1 CONC d warriors, led by war chiefs Satank and Satanta, rode across the Red Ri
1 CONC ver from Indian Territory and stormed the Hamleton cabin, which was on W
1 CONC alnut Creek about 15 miles north of Fort Worth, Texas.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Inside were Sara Hamleton and three children - Lavina Myres, 11, Mary Ha
1 CONC mleton, about 5, and Gus Hamleton, 18 months. Lavina was a half-sister t
1 CONC o Mary and Gus. Sara had remarried after the death of her first husband
1 CONC , James Myres.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Sara's husband, William, was having corn milled at Springtown, 10 mile
1 CONC s away. Of the other children, William Myres, 16, was herding cattle; an
1 CONC d Mahala Emiline Myres, 15, Eliza Jane Myres, 13, Samuel Myres, 9, and J
1 CONC ohn Myres, 7, were working in a nearby field.
1 CONT 
1 CONT According to Davis' research, the Indian raiders, after killing Sara Ham
1 CONC leton and scalping both her and the baby, took Lavina Myres and Mary Ham
1 CONC leton with them. About six months later, Lavina Myres was returned to he
1 CONC r family by Army officials at Fort Arbuckle - apparently after being ran
1 CONC somed with horses or other goods. It was reported then that her younge
1 CONC r sister was dead.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Mary Hamleton, as To-goam, whose foster parents were the warrior Tan-goo
1 CONC dle and his wife, Tope-kau-da, grew up to be well respected within the t
1 CONC ribe, partly for her skill at training horses.
1 CONT 
1 CONT When she was about 17, she married Calisay, another captive. The coupl
1 CONC e had seven children. She lived for 57 years in the Kiowa village, abou
1 CONC t seven miles south of Mountain View, OK.
1 CONT 
1 CONT A climax of Davis' project has been visiting To-goam's grave in the Rain
1 CONC y Mountain Cemetery. She died July 22, 1924, about age 62, and is burie
1 CONC d alongside Calisay, who died June 4, 1923. Her name on the tombstone i
1 CONC s Tagonegatty - a slight misspelling, family members say.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Davis also has become friends with her grandson, George Tahbone of nearb
1 CONC y Mountain View, one of To-goam's closest living descendants.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Tahbone, 76, is a former member of the Kiowa Business Committee. He als
1 CONC o has researched the history of his white grandmother.
1 CONT 
1 CONT It's believed that To-goam quickly forgot English - and virtually all he
1 CONC r early white childhood - and for the rest of her life spoke only Kiow
1 CONC a and was at heart a pure Kiowa.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Tahbone, who like his grandmother and all her known descendants is on th
1 CONC e Kiowa rolls, believes his grandfather's name of Calisay came from hi
1 CONC s captors' mispronunciation of Carlos. It's believed he was very young w
1 CONC hen captured, possibly in Mexico.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Davis said he confirmed the relationship between his relatives and To-go
1 CONC am when he discovered family journals telling of the Indian raid - the
1 CONC n found proof in Tarrant County, Texas, court records.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Davis said he learned of atrocities on both sides in the war between th
1 CONC e Texans and Indians. He cited reports that a rancher, incensed by India
1 CONC n horse thieves, put a bounty on Indian scalps, which he hung on his fro
1 CONC nt porch.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Davis continues to study his family history. He doesn't know how far i
1 CONC t will take him, but he can hardly wait to get there.

1 CONT Here is a portion of the article I have on the Indian Raid.
1 CONT 
1 CONT THE KIOWA RAID OF WALNUT CREEK
1 CONT In April 1867 a band of about sixty Kiowa warriors raided the home of Wi
1 CONC lliam Hamleton on Walnut Creek in northwest Tarrant County. Finding Mr
1 CONC . Hamleton away from home at the time, they killed his wife and took a
1 CONC t least two of his children into captivity. The raid, not unlike many ot
1 CONC hers which took place in North Texas during the 1850's, 1860's and 1870'
1 CONC s, is however remarkable for at least two reasons.
1 CONT 
1 CONT First, one of the children, Mary Hamleton, remained with the Indians fo
1 CONC r the rest of her life, and second, there exists an interview transcrip
1 CONC t with one of the Kiowas who took part in the raid. Northwest Tarrant Co
1 CONC unty was still thinly settled in the fall of 1860 when James Myres, hi
1 CONC s wife and six children settled on Walnut Creek. Mrs. Sally Myres wa
1 CONC s a daughter of another nearby settler, Nathan Allman, who had recentl
1 CONC y arrived from Dallas County, Missouri. Mr. Myers died in the spring o
1 CONC f 186?, and in a short time Mrs. Myers married William Hamleton (Hamilto
1 CONC n). The Hamletons had two children after their marriage. By 1867, they w
1 CONC ere living in a comfortable two-room log house with a dog-trot, just nor
1 CONC th of Walnut Creek and a few miles north of present-day Azle. While th
1 CONC e Hamletons were readying their cotton crop in the spring of 1867, Kiow
1 CONC a chiefs Satank and Satanta were organizing a band to go south into Texa
1 CONC s from the reservation in present-day Oklahoma. They left their camp o
1 CONC n the North Fork of Red River, crossed the main stream of the Red Rive
1 CONC r at Doan's Store north of present day Vernon in Wilbarger County and
1 CONT passed near Fort Richardson. Somewhere in that area, one of the Indian
1 CONC s remembered, they found a single white man, killed him, and rode on. Fi
1 CONC nally they located a single log house in the edge of the timber just nor
1 CONC th of a large creek, a little west of the West Fork of the Trinity River
1 CONC . It was the Hamleton's house. On the day the Kiowas found his house, Mr
1 CONC . Hamleton was away at Springtown in Parker County to have some millin
1 CONC g done. His eldest step-son, William Myres, was also away tending cattle
1 CONC . Four of the other Myres children were working in the cotton fields. Sa
1 CONC rina Myres, aged eleven was in the house
1 CONT with her mother and the two Hamleton children, Mary, aged about five, an
1 CONC d Gus who was about 18 months old. When the door was opened by the India
1 CONC ns, Mrs. Hamleton was seated at her loom.
1 CONT 
1 CONT The Indians first attacked the older children in the fields, but they es
1 CONC caped. Next they attacked the house. An-pay-Kau-te, Satank's oldest so
1 CONC n remembered. Some of our men went up to the house and kicked in the doo
1 CONC r. There was a great big fat woman inside and some children. The woman t
1 CONC ried to defend herself, so we killed her. I don't remember how many chil
1 CONC dren there were in the house. We grabbed them and came out on the run.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Sait-aim-pay-toy had one girl captive, Ho-to-yeah had another. We rode b
1 CONC ack toward our
1 CONT country. The Indians took everything from the house which they wanted. T
1 CONC hat night they stopped to camp in a grove of trees. As they were breakin
1 CONC g camp the next morning, the Indians were startled by a cloud of dust ri
1 CONC sing behind them. They immediately thought it was a group of settlers wh
1 CONC o were trying to recover the lost children. Mary Hamleton, who was ill o
1 CONC n the day the riad came, had been wrapped in a blanket and secured so th
1 CONC at she could not unwrap herself. In their haste to leave, the Indian wh
1 CONC o had been carrying her threw her to the ground, thinking she would undu
1 CONC ly slow their flight. When the Indians discovered that the dust cloud wa
1 CONC s caused by a herd of cattle and not by a group of avenging Texans, th
1 CONC e Indians halted and Mary's captor returned to get her. Apparently at hi
1 CONC s time the group holding Sarina Myres separated from the rest, since Sar
1 CONC ina later remembered nothing of her younger sister after seeing her lef
1 CONC t on the ground rolled in her blanket. Sarina told her story after her r
1 CONC ecapture, and it was commonly assumed that Mary had died or was killed w
1 CONC hile still wrapped in the blanket. Sarina stayed with the Kiowas about s
1 CONC ix months. Through the aid of a friendly Comanche named Asa Havey, she w
1 CONC as finally recovered at Fort Arbuckle from where her brother, William, e
1 CONC scorted her home. Sources disagree as to the fate of the youngest child
1 CONC , Gus. When questioned later by officials at the Kiowa agency, the Kiowa
1 CONC s swore that Mary Hamleton had been killed before she was thrown from th
1 CONC e raider's horse soon after her capture. In the face of this testimony
1 CONC , and because of Sarina Myres story as well, no further efforts were mad
1 CONC e to locate Mary. Mary Hamleton was not dead, however. The Indians wen
1 CONC t to great lengths for many years to hide her identity. Given to a warri
1 CONC or named Tan-Goodle and his wife, Tope-kau-da, she grew to womanhood an
1 CONC d married a Mexican captive named Ko-do-seet. As To-goam, Mary became a
1 CONC n accepted member of the Kiowas, and in later years was baptized into th
1 CONC e Baptist Church by J.J. Clous. When she died of a heart attack on Jul
1 CONC y 22, 1924, she was survived by two sons, five daughters and many grandc
1 CONC hildren. She was buried in Rainy Mountain Baptist Mission Cemetery in Ok
1 CONC lahoma. William Hamleton lived only about two years after the death of h
1 CONC is wife. The Hamleton house on Walnut Creek, later owned by King Dent, s
1 CONC tood in its original form and in its original location until Eagle Munta
1 CONC in Reservior was build on the West Fork of the Trinity River in 1931. A
1 CONC t that time, the cabin site was flooded.

1 CONT "The Darby family, of which Mr. Miller s mother is a member, is one of t

1 CONC t ancestor was Ezra Darby, who came to America from Devonshire, England
1 CONC , in 1620. The first of the line of whom definite records are still in e

1 CONC , 1775, and is buried in the old cemetery at Scotch Plains, New Jersey
1 CONC . The fourth of their seven children, Samuel Darby was born about 1730 a

1 CONT 
1 CONT On 24 July 1629 Thomas Brownell of Yorkshire, son of Robert Brownell, fa
1 CONC rmer, of Rawe Marsh, Yorkshire was apprenticed to Thomas Wilson of the C

1 CONT Thomas Brownell m. Anne Bourne at St. Benets & St. Peters, Paul's Wharf
1 CONC , London March 20,1637/38[4] and came to New England about 1640. (Transc
1 CONC ript - Mar.16,1640) (see published registers).
1 CONT 
1 CONT Thomas and Anne Brownell were the first members of the Brownell family t
1 CONC o emigrate to America. Most Brownells in the United States and Canada ar
1 CONC e descended from them. They arrived in New England in 1638, on board th
1 CONC e ship Whale. According to the ship's passenger list, they had lived i
1 CONC n the London parish of St. Mary Colechurch before making the journey t
1 CONC o America.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Thomas and Anne Brownell settled first in Mt. Wollaston (later known a
1 CONC s Braintree) Massachusetts, where Thomas was a "planter" or farmer. Th
1 CONC e first record of him there is in the notebook or legal memoranda of Tho
1 CONC mas Lechford. He sold "a house, a garden and six acres of arable land i
1 CONC n Braintree" to Deodatus Curtis. The deed is undated, but occurs betwee
1 CONC n entries of 26 May and 11 June 1640.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Sometime between 1639 and 1641, Thomas and Anne moved to the settlemen
1 CONC t of Portsmouth on Rhode Island (currently known as Aquidneck Island
1 CONC ) . Since their first child, Mary, was born in Massachusetts Bay Colon
1 CONC y in 1639, and their second child, Sarah, was born in Rhode Island in 16
1 CONC 41, the timeframe seems plausible. See below for more about early Rhod
1 CONC e Island.
1 CONT 
1 CONT It was among these "heretics" that Thomas and Anne chose to make their p
1 CONC ermanent home in America. While there are no records which state that th
1 CONC e Brownells moved to Portsmouth in 1640, the record of the sale of thei
1 CONC r house in Braintree in 1640 would make that a logical conclusion. Thei
1 CONC r remaining eight children are said to have been born in Portsmouth; alt
1 CONC hough, as in Braintree, there are no records to substantiate this.
1 CONT 
1 CONT He is called cousin, of Portsmouth, R.I. in the will of Thomas Wilson th
1 CONC e elder, citizen & cloth worker of London but now resident of Rycroft i
1 CONC n the parish of Rawmarsh, Co. of York, dated 25 Feb.1657, proved 14 Feb.
1 CONC 1658(9), by which he and his children were given L 20 - (Register Vol.4
1 CONC 6 p.454-5).[5]
1 CONT Death
1 CONT On the afternoon of 24 September 1664, Thomas Brownell, then age 56, wa
1 CONC s killed in an accident while on his way from his farm at the northwes
1 CONC t end of Rhode Island to Portsmouth. (The Brownells, as was typical of m
1 CONC ost settlers at that time, probably did not live on their farm. They wou
1 CONC ld also have had a small lot in Portsmouth where they built their home a
1 CONC nd lived, going to their farm during the day to work.) Thomas left behin
1 CONC d a wife, Anne, and nine children, ranging in age from nine to twenty-fi
1 CONC ve years.
1 CONT 
1 CONT According to the testimony of Daniel Lawton, Brownell had stopped at th
1 CONC e home of Lawton's father, Thomas Lawton, and upon leaving, invited Dani
1 CONC el, aged 21, to ride with him the rest of the way to Portsmouth. The rid
1 CONC e soon became a race when Thomas put his horse to a gallop as they cam
1 CONC e down the hill near William Wodel's property, located about halfway bet
1 CONC ween the Brownell farm and the town of Portsmouth. The younger man soo
1 CONC n caught up with and passed Thomas.
1 CONT 
1 CONT As he continued the race to Portsmouth, Lawton looked back to see wher
1 CONC e Brownell was. Seeing his riderless horse running towards a swamp he im
1 CONC mediately turned his horse around and caught Brownell's horse.
1 CONT 
1 CONT He then retraced his way until he came upon Brownell lying on the groun
1 CONC d near a tree. He called out to him, but received no response and so dis
1 CONC mounted to check on him. Taking him by the arms and seeing the great amo
1 CONC unt of blood on the ground, Lawton realized that Thomas Brownell was dea
1 CONC d.
1 CONT 
1 CONT The following day a coroner's jury, with Samuel Wilbur as foreman, mad
1 CONC e an inquest into the accident. Testimony was taken from Daniel Lawton a
1 CONC nd details about the scene of the accident were given.
1 CONT 
1 CONT The jury's conclusion was that Brownell, riding furiously down the hill
1 CONC , was either thrown against or hit the tree. The broken reins of his bri
1 CONC dle had been found next to the body and there was blood and hair stickin
1 CONC g to the tree. His skull was broken and his "brains came out," thus caus
1 CONC ing his death.

1 CONT Estate
1 CONT On 9-16-1665, c. 1 year after Thomas’s death, Portsmouth’s Town Council
1 CONC , acting as a Probate Court, awarded his widow Anne a life estate in hal
1 CONC f of the intestate decedent’s realty (the widow to choose her half) an
1 CONC d awarded to eldest son George the remainder interest plus the other hal
1 CONC f of the realty, said half to vest when he came of age (in about 2 years
1 CONC ). [6] This division followed applicable law of intestate succession exc
1 CONC ept that a widow’s right of dower was a life estate in one-third, not on
1 CONC e-half, of her husband’s realty. The Council’s Order appointed the wido
1 CONC w administrator of Thomas’s estate and imposed on her the obligation t
1 CONC o pay legacies of 10 shillings to her two married daughters Mary and Sar
1 CONC ah and 20 pounds to each of her 6 other children (see “Children” below
1 CONC ) except George when they married (or attained age 21 if male). The Orde
1 CONC r required Anne to post a bond of 200 pounds to secure her performance o
1 CONC f those obligations.
1 CONT 
1 CONT There is no record of any inventory of the estate. However, the amount

1 CONT The Council’s Order directed the administrator to honor a contract mad

1 CONT About Early Rhode Island
1 CONT In 1638, Portsmouth was settled by a group of supporters of Anne Hutchin
1 CONC son who had been banished from Boston after excommunication from the Bos
1 CONC ton Church. With the help of Roger Williams the Island of Aquidneck wa
1 CONC s purchased from the Indians and a settlement was established at an are
1 CONC a called Pocasset. The name was changed to Portsmouth the following year
1 CONC .
1 CONT 
1 CONT The settlements of Newport and Portsmouth were situated on what is commo
1 CONC nly called Aquidneck Island today, but it was called Rhode Island in Col
1 CONC onial times. Providence Plantation was the name of the colony founded b
1 CONC y Roger Williams in the area now known as the city of Providence. This w
1 CONC as adjoined by the settlement of Warwick; hence the plural Providence Pl
1 CONC antations.
1 CONT 
1 CONT In 1644, Providence, Portsmouth, and Newport united for their common ind
1 CONC ependence as the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, gove
1 CONC rned by an elected council and "president".[citation needed]

1 CONT https://freepages.rootsweb.com/~shipleyharrison/genealogy/harkriderhisto
1 CONC ry.htm#harkriderhist
1 CONT 
1 CONT The first Harkrider I was able to find was Johannes Harkrader who came t
1 CONC o the New World in 1733 from the area we know as Germany. He settled i
1 CONC n Philadelphia and later moved with his family to Maryland. Most of hi
1 CONC s children were christened in the Zion Moslem Lutheran Church. There i
1 CONC s also evidence that his wife's family were Quakers.
1 CONT 
1 CONT  
1 CONT 
1 CONT His son, David, moved to Virginia and lived there for over 20 years. Dav
1 CONC id's son, Reese Harkrider, was born in Virginia and moved to Tennessee a
1 CONC bout1840 where he married Mahala Horton.
1 CONT 
1 CONT  
1 CONT 
1 CONT Mahala's grandfather, Daniel Horton, served with the North Carolina Mili
1 CONC tia during the Revolutionary War. He served for nine months beginning i
1 CONC n June 1778 and fought in the Battle of Kings Mountain in North Carolina
1 CONC . He was originally in the company commanded by Captain Martin in the re
1 CONC giments of both Colonels Armstrong and Shelby. As a Quaker, he was not p
1 CONC ermitted to enter military service, and as a consequence, was ejected fr
1 CONC om the Quaker Church.
1 CONT 
1 CONT There is record of his having received a pension for his service in th
1 CONC e Revolutionary War. He received $80 Sept 1832 and March 1833; also hi
1 CONC s children were paid $40, his pension from March 4, 1838 to August 18, 1
1 CONC 839 "the day of his death". There is much known about the Horton family.
1 CONT 
1 CONT  
1 CONT 
1 CONT Reese Harkrider moved his family to Macon County, Illinois about 1854. I
1 CONC t was there that his daughter, Frances Elizabeth Harkrider, met and marr
1 CONC ied David Calvin Allmon. They moved to Texas about 1878.
1 CONT 
1 CONT  
1 CONT 
1 CONT There are several variations in the spelling of the HARKRIDER name.  Som
1 CONC e of the names you will find are Herrgeroder, Hercheroder, Herchelroder
1 CONC , Harkrader, Harkrider, Harkerader, Hargerader, etc. People who descende
1 CONC d from Johannes Harkrader may use any of these variations today. There a
1 CONC re Harkrider's in Brady and San Saba, Texas today.

1 CONT 
1 CONT  
1 CONT 
1 CONT Johannes Herrgeroder, a Palatine, arrived in Philadelphia on the ship El
1 CONC izabeth in 1733 at the age of 19.  It isn't known where he was born, bu
1 CONC t safe to say it was probably in the area we know as Germany.
1 CONT 
1 CONT  
1 CONT 
1 CONT Generally speaking, a "Palatine" is someone who came from the region o
1 CONC f Germany known as "The Palatinate". Prior to 1871, what is now German
1 CONC y was a number of separate states, such as Wurttemberg, Prussia, Bavaria
1 CONC , etc. In the 18th century, the term "Palatine" was used in America to d
1 CONC escribe immigrants from this area and other adjoining German-speaking ar
1 CONC eas. Therefore, being from the "Palatinate" may not point to a specifi
1 CONC c place of origin, but rather an approximate location in or near wester
1 CONC n or southern Germany.

1 CONT 
1 CONT REESE B. HARKRIDER was born 11 October 1821 in Tazewell Co., VA, and die
1 CONC d 06 October 1875 in Macon Co., IL.  He married twice. First he marrie
1 CONC d MAHALA HORTON 23 March 1841 in McMinn Co., TN, daughter of JESSE HORTO
1 CONC N and ANNA DYKES.  She was born 01 May 1822 in Washington Co., TN, and d
1 CONC ied Bet. 1860 - 1870 in Macon Co., IL.  He married second his daughter
1 CONC ’s sister-in-law, AMANDA M. ALLMON, 20 November 1870 in Macon Co., IL, d
1 CONC aughter of WILLIAM ALLMON and JANE COWAN.  She was born 1846 in Missouri
1 CONC , and died Aft. 1880.
1 CONT 
1 CONT  
1 CONT 
1 CONT In 1850 Reese, Mahala and two children were in McMinn County, Tennessee
1 CONC . The Harkrider family moved to Macon Co., IL ca 1855. Although we don'
1 CONC t know why they moved to Illinois, we do know that Mahala's parents an
1 CONC d siblings also moved from McMinn County, TN to Macon Co., IL about th
1 CONC e same time. Many Horton's are buried in North Fork Cemetery, Decatur, I
1 CONC llinois.
1 CONT 
1 CONT  
1 CONT 
1 CONT By 1860 they are in Macon Co., IL with five children including Frances E
1 CONC lizabeth age 8.  They were living near several Wheeler families and tha
1 CONC t is probably how Reese met Amanda Allmon Wheeler whom he later marrie
1 CONC d in Macon Co., IL after both their spouses died.
1 CONT 
1 CONT  
1 CONT

1 CONT 
1 CONT In 1870 Reese and three children, Matilda, Frances and Martha are livin
1 CONC g in Long Creek Township, Macon Co., IL.  Mahala and two of their sons
1 CONC , James and Jessie, have apparently died by that time.  In November of t
1 CONC hat year, he and Amanda Allmon Wheeler married.
1 CONT 
1 CONT  
1 CONT 
1 CONT I don't know exactly when Amanda's first husband, John Wheeler, died bu
1 CONC t they were only married a few years. Their son William was born in 186
1 CONC 8 and by Nov. 1870 John had died and she married Reese B. Harkrider. I h
1 CONC ave a copy of the Marriage Register from Macon County, Illinois. The lis
1 CONC ting shows Reason B. Harkrader and Mrs. Amanda M. Wheeler got marriage l
1 CONC icense number 263 on November 19, 1879 and were married by W.L. Bankston
1 CONC , Minister of the Gospel, on Nov. 20, 1870. I wonder if his given name w
1 CONC as "Reason" or "Reese"? He had a sister named "Vice".
1 CONT 
1 CONT  
1 CONT 
1 CONT Amanda and Reese were married less than five years when he died in 187
1 CONC 5 leaving her pregnant and with two small daughters. It appears that he
1 CONC r third child by Reese, Hattie C., died before 1880. I've not yet locate
1 CONC d Amanda beyond 1880 and don't know if she remarried again nor when sh
1 CONC e died.
1 CONT 
1 CONT  
1 CONT 
1 CONT In the probate records of Macon County, Illinois I found records showin
1 CONC g that Reese B. Harkrider died 6th day of October 1875. The administrato
1 CONC rs of his estate were David Calvin Allmon and Amanda Harkrider. He die
1 CONC d owing money to several people. As a result his estate was appraised an
1 CONC d many items were sold to pay creditors.

1 CONT Frances and David Allmon lived in Macon County, Illinois for about seve

1 CONC nt Counties by that time. Frances and David had three young sons at tha
1 CONC t time aged 1 - 5 yrs. Their fourth child, Hattie, was born in 1879 in G
1 CONC rayson County, Texas. So, it's possible that Frances was pregnant with H
1 CONC attie during the long 700+ mile wagon trip to Texas. Frances' sister, Ma

1 CONT NOTES:As written byhis son Lon Almand in 1977
1 CONT In all attempts to write something about the life of our father, wha
1 CONC t I write will be from facts and things that I remember, or think I reme
1 CONC mber, from bits of remarks that I heard him make during my life in the h
1 CONC ome. Some of the dates and remarks may not be exact; in fact, they wil
1 CONC l probably be remembered differently by any of the other members of th
1 CONC e family. They could be correct in their thinking.
1 CONT The records show that his father was William W. Almand and his mother wa
1 CONC s Frances (Minchew) Almand.It is generally believed that he migrated t
1 CONC o Florida from Georgia - probably a place near Atlanta - although we hav
1 CONC e no facts to prove it.Some think there might have been a brother with h
1 CONC im in the migration.The brother is believed to have gone down to the eas
1 CONC t coast of the state, and he (grandfather) located in north Florida nea
1 CONC r a place called Barbervillle, in Volusia County.It was here that he me
1 CONC t and married our grandmother, Frances Minchew.Into this union were bor
1 CONC n three children - Jackson W., Emma, and our father William Lee Almand.
1 CONT When our father was very small his father left to serve in the Confedera
1 CONC te Army, never to return.I remember hearing him say that someone told hi
1 CONC m that he was just beginning to pull up to a chair and stand, and when h
1 CONC is father left he said, "I will never see that child again."This prove
1 CONC d to be true for it was while on this mission that he died in a hospita
1 CONC l at Cherry Point, North Carolina.The cause of death I do not know.
1 CONT This, of course, left a widow with three small children to care for.Sure
1 CONC ly that family lived together as best they could but tragedy was soon t
1 CONC o happen again.When father was about 6 years of age, their mother died l
1 CONC eaving the three as orphans.The children were taken into the house of re
1 CONC latives, which, in some cases, was not very satisfactory.They were event
1 CONC ually taken by their uncle and aunt, William and Matilda Minchew, wher
1 CONC e they were cared for properly.
1 CONT (William Minchew was their mother's brother.)
1 CONT As they grew older, of course, the children went their separate ways.I
1 CONC t was about this time that Henry B. Plant built the railroad into Tamp
1 CONC a which extended as far as Bartow through Punta Gorda and finally to For
1 CONC t Myers.All of this activity created extra work, and our father, as a yo
1 CONC ung man, came down seeking work.I remember hearing him tell about his tr
1 CONC ip down on the country roads, especially around Eustis and Leesburg.Whet
1 CONC her he traveled by horseback or with a horse and cart I do not know, bu
1 CONC t it was a thrilling journey.His journey ended at Arcadia.It was here th
1 CONC at he met and married Emaline Valdosta Johnson.To them were born two chi
1 CONC ldren - Drew and Birdie.This
1 CONT marriage soon ended in divorce.I do not know the reason for this separat
1 CONC ion, and I do not recall ever hearing it discussed in our family.All I k
1 CONC now is that he was given custody of the children.
1 CONT It must have been soon after his arrival at Arcadia that he found a jo
1 CONC b as a section hand on the railroad which led to the later job as Sectio
1 CONC n Foreman for the Atlantic Coastline Railroad.How this happened is a rat
1 CONC her interesting story.The foreman of the section adjoining the Arcadia s
1 CONC ection on the north left for the weekend and when he failed to return th
1 CONC e next Monday, the roadmaster asked father to go up there and take charg
1 CONC e until the regular man returned.He never returned and father kept the j
1 CONC ob as foreman.This section of track was eight miles long, reaching fro
1 CONC m Brownsville on the south to Buchanan on the north.It was here that h
1 CONC e met our mother, Naoma Whidden.This, again, is an
1 CONT interesting story.In those days the trains were pulled by wood burning e
1 CONC ngines; the wood was supplied by the farmers along the route.It must b
1 CONC e remembered that wood was in abundance then and there were no restricti
1 CONC ons on cutting it as most of the land was owned by the government.This w
1 CONC ood was cut in four foot lengths and placed on what was called a wood ra
1 CONC ck which was divided into eight or ten sections, each section containin
1 CONC g one-half cord of wood.The platform to the rack was built near the rail
1 CONC road track and up to the
1 CONT height of the tender or part of the engine that held the wood supply.Whe
1 CONC n the wood supply on the engine ran short, they would stop at a wood rac
1 CONC k and get a new supply, leave a receipt, and proceed on their journey.Al
1 CONC so, by this wood rack was a place where cross ties, which the farmer ha
1 CONC d cut, were placed until they could be inspected for purchase by the rai
1 CONC lroad company.This is where our mother came into the picture.Her father
1 CONC , John Whidden, had one of these racks and made his living supplying cor
1 CONC d wood and cross ties to the railroad company.There were six children i
1 CONC n this family, five girls and one boy - Martha, Naoma, Lennie, Callie, J
1 CONC ohn,and Ida, in that order, I believe.Since
1 CONT the boy was too young to do heavy work and the older sister just not gif
1 CONC ted to hard work, it fell our mother's lot to take on a man's job and he
1 CONC lp her father with the work.She, with a pair of oxen and wagon, did th
1 CONC e hauling of the wood and ties, while he did the cutting.Since the woo
1 CONC d rack was located on a portion of the section where our father passes v
1 CONC ery often, it was here that they probably met.
1 CONT When there are people, there is always some kind of a social gathering.I
1 CONC n those days it was very often the Saturday night square dance at some n
1 CONC eighbor's home where they tuned up the fiddle and had a big time.Many o
1 CONC f these dances were at the Whidden home, and it was at one of them tha
1 CONC t mother and father were married.There were seven children born into thi
1 CONC s family - Eva, Leland, Lon, Frances, Ethel, Emile, and Pasco.Frances di
1 CONC ed in early childhood, and all the others grew to adulthood and had fami
1 CONC lies of their own.
1 CONT The tool house and headquarters for father's section were located at Cal
1 CONC vinia, a place where the railroad crosses Big Charley Creek.When he too
1 CONC k the job and moved to Calvinia, he was told by well-meaning friends tha
1 CONC t he would never be able to live there because the people were too rough
1 CONC .You would have to know our father to know how little that disturbed him
1 CONC .I don't think he ever feared any man.I remember hearing him tell how ma
1 CONC ny times he would leave for work with a shot gun on the hand car for pro
1 CONC tection.The reason for this resentment from the people was that they wer
1 CONC e mad at the railroad
1 CONT company, and if you worked for them you were one of them.The trains wer
1 CONC e killing many of the people's cattle and hogs, and the company would no
1 CONC t pay for them.You mix that with a jug of booze and you have problems.Th
1 CONC is was overcome though and nothing serious happened.
1 CONT Believe it or not, while living here he had a contract with the Post Off
1 CONC ice Department to carry the mail on a star route fromCalvinia to Crewsvi
1 CONC lle.Although he did not carry the mail himself, he hired a friend (Fran
1 CONC k Terrell) to carry it.He furnished him with equipment to do the job.H
1 CONC e had three horses that were used; one on one trip and two on the next t
1 CONC rip.
1 CONT It was while living there that his brother (Uncle Jack) came down and wo
1 CONC rked with him on the section.He later became foreman of the section at Z
1 CONC olfo Springs which adjoined father's section on the north.Two brothers c
1 CONC ould not have had closer relations.They would always arrange their work
1 CONC , if possible, so they could meet once a week where their sections joine
1 CONC d and visit for a while.
1 CONT About 1903, the railroad company built houses at Gardner and the famil
1 CONC y was moved there to live.Although the work hours were long (there was n
1 CONC o 8-hour day then) father always managed to have something going on th
1 CONC e side to boost his income.Soon after moving to Gardner, he, with a loca
1 CONC l farmer as a partner, opened a general merchandise store.This proved t
1 CONC o be a bad venture and they soon dissolved partnerships; then he opene
1 CONC d a store of his own.He hired a cousin (Willie Minchew) to run this busi
1 CONC ness for him.He also bought 3-1/2 acres of land and adjoining the railro
1 CONC ad property and immediately started farming it.The merchandise busines
1 CONC s did not last long, but he continued to farm his plot of land until abo
1 CONC ut 1908 when he sold it to the local depot
1 CONT agent.In the meantime, the estate of our mother's parents was for sale a
1 CONC nd he bought it.In the fall and winter of 1909, he built a house on thi
1 CONC s property, and in February 1910, he moved the family to it.He later tra
1 CONC ded it for what we call the "old home place" at Fish Branch.
1 CONT Soon after trading for this property, he retired from the railroad and d
1 CONC evoted all of his time to farming.He built a new house and improved th
1 CONC e property.As the years passed and he and mother grew too old to care fo
1 CONC r the farm, they sold it and moved to Tampa where they lived until he di
1 CONC ed in November, 1946.So, came to a close the life of as grand a father a
1 CONC s anyone could wish for

1 CONT NOTE:As written by his son Norman Pasco Almand in 1977
1 CONT THE ALMAND RE-UNION
1 CONT Who Are We?
1 CONT       We are the descendents of the late William L. (Lee) Almand and th
1 CONC e late Naomi (Whidden) Almand.We shall refer to these two as Granddadd
1 CONC y and Grandma Almand.
1 CONT Little is known of Granddaddy's ancestry.He was a son of William W. Alma
1 CONC nd and Frances (Minchew) Almand, of Volusia County who migrated there fr
1 CONC om Georgia. He had one brother and one sister.Jackson W. Almand and Emm
1 CONC a (Almand) (Fussel) Whidden.His father William W. Almand went into the s
1 CONC ervices of the Confederacy when Granddaddy was just a child.Just old eno
1 CONC ugh to pull up to a Chair.He never returned from the war, but news reach
1 CONC ed the family that he became ill and died in a hospital in South Carolin
1 CONC a on his way home.
1 CONT       His mother Frances Almand died while Granddaddy was still a smal
1 CONC l boy.As an orphan child he was taken in by relatives, shifting from th
1 CONC e homes of two uncles, Jim Sauls and Ben Richardson.Another uncle, Willi
1 CONC am (Bill) Minchew saw that this was not working out very satisfactoril
1 CONC y and took him into his home where he stayed until he went out into th
1 CONC e world on his own. Granddaddy never ceased to praise this uncle for wha
1 CONC t he did for him.
1 CONT       After leaving Uncle Bill's house, Grandaddy married Miss Dorsey Jo
1 CONC hnson.Two children were born of this marriage, Drew and Birdie. The marr
1 CONC iage finally ended in divorce.Later he married Miss Naomi Whidden.By thi
1 CONC s marriage seven children were born.Eva, Leland, Lon, Frankie, Ethel, Em
1 CONC ile, and Pasco.
1 CONT       Grandma was a daughter of John Whidden and Sarah(Phillips) Whidden
1 CONC , of DeSoto County, who migrated there from Georgia.She had four sister
1 CONC s and onebrother, Martha (Whidden) (Burlson) Williford, Lennie (Whidden
1 CONC ) Williams, Caledonia (Whidden) Earnest, Ida (Whidden) Stone, and John E
1 CONC . Whidden.Grandma's father wasa poor man having to work at anything he c
1 CONC ould find to earn a living.When the railroads were built in
1 CONT his part of the country he secured a contract to furnish cord wood for t
1 CONC he train engines.The engines of that day were wood burners.It was necess
1 CONC ary for him to have help in cutting and hauling this wood.Since the onl
1 CONC y boy was too young to help, Grandma was elected.Some job for a girl bu
1 CONC t that's the way it was.Many times she hitched up the oxen, went out alo
1 CONC ne, cut the wood with an ax and hauled it to the railroad wood yard wher
1 CONC e she stacked it for the train crew to pick up.This wood was cut in fou
1 CONC r foot lengths.A cord stacked was four feet high and eight feet long.I
1 CONC t was during this time that she and Granddaddy met and were married.
1 CONT       Granddaddy was a railroad section foreman.Also his brother Jack.Th
1 CONC ey had adjoining sections and a wonderful brother relationship.A rule o
1 CONC f the railroad company was, that a foreman should inspect his entire sec
1 CONC tion once each week.On a set day of the week Uncle Jack would inspect th
1 CONC e south end of his section and Granddaddy would inspect the north end o
1 CONC f his.A strange thing about this was that they would reach the adjoinin
1 CONC g line at the same time and it would always be exactly at lunch time.O
1 CONC f course they would have lunch and visit together during that hour.You m
1 CONC ight be let to think that this was pre-arranged.And it was.Another thin
1 CONC g about this relationship worth mentioning was that Grandaddy was neve
1 CONC r know to criticize "Brother Jack" as he referred to him, nor, would h
1 CONC e allow another to do so in his presence.If your thoughts were good, sa
1 CONC y so.If not it was advisable to keep silent.
1 CONT       We who have known Granddaddy, knew him as a hard working man, prov
1 CONC iding well for his family.Known for his honesty, truthfulness and punctu
1 CONC ality.He was a man of high principles and clean habits, admired by thos
1 CONC e in the community in which he lived.Surely the world was better off bec
1 CONC ause he lived here.And Grandma helped.She too, was quite a gal.
1 CONT      
1 CONT       An old man going a lone highway,
1 CONT       Came at the evening, cold and gray,
1 CONT       To a chasm vast, deep and wide,

1 CONT       The old man crossed in the twilight dim,
1 CONT       The sullen stream had no fear for him;
1 CONT       But he turned when safe on the other side
1 CONT       And built a bridge to span the tide.
1 CONT       "Old man," said a fellow pilgrim near,
1 CONT       "You are wasting your strength with building here,
1 CONT       Your journey will end with ending day;
1 CONT       You never again will pass this way.
1 CONT       You've passed the chasm deep and wide,
1 CONT       Why build you the bridge at eventide?"
1 CONT       The builder lifted his old grey head:
1 CONT       "Good friend in the path I've come," he said
1 CONT       "There followeth after me today
1 CONT       A youth whose feet must pass this way.
1 CONT       This chasm that has been naught to me
1 CONT       To that fair-haired youth may a pit-fall be;     
1 CONT       He, too, must cross in the twilight dim.
1 CONT       Good friend, I'm building the bridge for him."

0 @N0607@ NOTE The Rochester arm of the firm employed 450 men at its West Avenue f
1 CONC actory, known as Lincoln Park. The facility underwent a major expansio
1 CONC n in 1907, by which time all manufacturing operations for GRS had been r
1 CONC elocated to Rochester.
1 CONT 
1 CONT This meant jobs for Rochester. The work force quickly expanded to 1,00
1 CONC 0 workers and the factory on West Avenue was operating day and night. B
1 CONC y the end of the first quarter of 1910, GRS’ production level and revenu
1 CONC e had surpassed its entire 1909 output.
1 CONT 
1 CONT GRS was a good place to start a career. The firm provided extra-curricul
1 CONC ar activities for its employees, including a bowling league and basebal
1 CONC l league. Different departments played each other as well as teams fro
1 CONC m other companies. Baseball was so popular with GRS employees that the
1 CONC y created an indoor baseball league with four teams that played at Expos
1 CONC ition Park on Saturday nights. In the summertime, GRS employees were als
1 CONC o treated to an annual picnic, usually a daylong event at Ontario Beac
1 CONC h Park.
1 CONT 
1 CONT The Great War provided more work for GRS. Although the United States di
1 CONC d not enter the war until 1917, GRS began supplying artillery shells fo
1 CONC r the British Army in 1915. The demand for munitions increased substanti
1 CONC ally two years later, with the firm producing artillery shells by the th
1 CONC ousands.
1 CONT 
1 CONT GRS’ expanded market created a demand for more workers to produce not on
1 CONC ly munitions but an increasing number of railroad controls as well. Rail
1 CONC roads moved military men and materiels across the nation and the train
1 CONC s needed to be kept running efficiently and effectively.
1 CONT 
1 CONT The military draft focused on young men aged 21 to 31, so in order to no
1 CONC t interfere with the draft, GRS started to look for older workers to fil
1 CONC l the vacancies created by young men going off to war, as well as teenag
1 CONC e girls and boys.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Of the GRS employees who went overseas, four–Lionel Hanneman, Andrew Vin
1 CONC cent Hogan, Walter P. Sparrboom Jr. and Fred John Stager–lost their live
1 CONC s during the Great War.
1 CONT 
1 CONT General Railway Signal Company was a steady employer during its first tw
1 CONC o decades, providing round the clock jobs for Rochester workers, as wel
1 CONC l as high-quality products for the war effort. After the war, even thoug
1 CONC h there were no longer military contacts, the growth of the railroads i
1 CONC n America and around the world kept GRS employees very busy for years t
1 CONC o come.

1 CONT JOST SCHWAB - ORIGINAL RECORD EVIDENCES
1 CONT l. Letter of June 1, 1959 to Robert Long, Flourtown, Pennsylvania from
1 CONT Pastor Gerd Boettcher of the Lutheran Church at Duehren, Kreis
1 CONT Sinsheim, Baden.
1 CONT Dear Mr. Long,
1 CONT Today I got by a circuitous route your letter of Jan. 2,1959 to the
1 CONT veterinarian, Dr. Schwab, of Sinsheim. At the moment I am really very
1 CONT busy, as there will be a visiting delegation to my church next Sunday,
1 CONT and day after tomorrow I have to fly to Berlin for a conference. But
1 CONT your letter has already been knocking about here so long that I want
1 CONT to give you at least some sort of response.
1 CONT Right away I looked in the oldest church archives for the name of your
1 CONT relative, Jost Schwab, and did indeed find a page on which is
1 CONT inscribed something about Jost Schwab and his familial connections,
1 CONT but unfortunately the script is of such outmoded style that I need
1 CONT time to decipher it. Perhaps I'll get around soon to communicating the
1 CONT precise entries to you. Until then I just wanted today to inform you
1 CONT that you can come on to some new tracks in your genealogioal research
1 CONT here in Duehren, a small town in the neighborhood of Sinsheim. In case
1 CONT you come to this region I would be glad to help you.
1 CONT I have been able so far to translate one entry: Jost Schwab was
1 CONT married to Anna Katharina of the Buergermeister family of Wolfhardt
1 CONT here in Duehren. The Wolfhardt's are a very interesting family here in
1 CONT the Kraichgau. One of their number was pastor during the Thirty Years
1 CONT War and wrote the only intact diary of that time that has been
1 CONT well-preserved here in our Duehren church archives.
1 CONT Maybe sometime I shall have the pleasure of making your personal
1 CONT acquaintance.
1 CONT Very sincerely yours,
1 CONT Gerd Boettcher, Pastor

1 CONT 3. Letter of August 27, 1962, from Pastor Gerhard Niemann of the
1 CONT Lutheran Church at Duehren:
1 CONT Dear Mr. Long,
1 CONT When I recently entered upon my pastoral service in Duehren I soon
1 CONT discovered a letter that you wrote ca January 2, 1959 to Dr. Schwab of
1 CONT Sinsheim. At that time Dr. Schwab probably forwarded it to our
1 CONT pastoral office here for an answer to be worked out here, but my
1 CONT predecessor then neglected the matter. Do not therefore be too much
1 CONT annoyed if you have not received a reply before this.
1 CONT For quite a while I have occupied myself with your matter and was also
1 CONT able to find out some things. Let us start out with Johannes Schwab.
1 CONT From the Luterhan pastor's office at Leimen I was able to get an
1 CONT extract from the register of births from the year 1704, aocording to
1 CONT which this Johannes was baptized May 28, 1704 in Leimen. Since on
1 CONT account of infant mortality at the time it was customary to baptize no
1 CONT later than the second day after birth, he was born, therefore, on May
1 CONT 26 or 27, 1704. The parente were Jost Schwab and his wife, Anna
1 CONT Katharina. I enolose the certified extract.
1 CONT Jost (i.e., Justus) Schwab, designated ,,Schwaben zu Duehren bei
1 CONT Sinsheim" in the ancient records, really turns up in our oldest church
1 CONT record-book. He was married May 17, 1681 to Anna Katharina Wolfhart.
1 CONT From this marriage issued the following children:
1 CONT l. Hans Joerg, born July 19, 1682 in Duehren.
1 CONT 2. Jost Conrad, born April 29, 1687 in Duehren.
1 CONT 3. Jost Conrad, born January 11, 1690 in Duehren.
1 CONT 4. Anna Elisabeth, born Octobor 10, 1692 in Duehren.
1 CONT 5. Anna Magdalena, born April 11, 1697 in Duehren.
1 CONT 6. Maria, born October 9, 1698 in Duehren.
1 CONT 7. Johannes, born about May 27, 1704 in Leimen.
1 CONT 8. Hans Ulrich, born about October 20, 1707 in Leimen.
1 CONT Therefore, Jost Schwab lived in Duehren from 1681 till about 1700.
1 CONT From then on the name Schwab disappeared in Duehren. Only in the year
1 CONT 1702 a citi- and master-baker, Albrecht Schwab, is named as godfather
1 CONT in our church archives. This is probably a brother of Jost Schwab.
1 CONT One more thing about this Jost: you write that he lived from 1678 on.
1 CONT That cannot be right, as he already married in 1681. Where did you get
1 CONT this date, anyhow?
1 CONT George Schwab was the father of Jost. He was a citzen and councilman
1 CONT in the year 1681 in Sinsheim. Unfortunately, I was not able to find
1 CONT out
1 CONT page 1300
1 CONT anything in Sinsheim about this Georg Schwab - neither the dates of
1 CONT his birth and marriage nor anything about his wife, for in the
1 CONT so-called War of the Palatine Succession (Liselotte of the
1 CONT Palatinate!) Sinsheim was, as well as Heidelberg, totally destroyed,
1 CONT and in the process all the ancient records were also lost (burned).
1 CONT According to your letter this father of Jost Schwab is supposed to
1 CONT have been a Buergermeister in Leimen.(see page 1305) It would very
1 CONT much interest me to know where you got that information. For in the
1 CONT "Contributions to the Local History of the Community of Leimen" by
1 CONT Georg Ludwig Menzer, the sequence of Buergermeister of Leimen is set
1 CONT forth, but no Schwab is mentioned. Therein, it is only mentioned that
1 CONT in 1702 Jost Schwab moved from Sinsheim to Leimen and was immediately
1 CONT at the age of 46 - so he was born in 1655 - enrolled as a citizen
1 CONT (elector).
1 CONT So that was all I could find out about the Schwabs. It was no easy job
1 CONT to dig up all I did. On the other hand, much more might be reported
1 CONT about the mother of Johannes Schwab, the Anna Katharina nee Wolffhart.
1 CONT If you were also interested in that, you should let me know by another
1 CONT letter, and then I'll do it. Her father was Buergermeister in Duehren.
1 CONT Her grandfather was pastor in Duehren, and her great-grandfather was
1 CONT the Lutheran abbot of the Alpirsbach cloister in the Black Forest and
1 CONT Councilor to the Duke of Wuerttemberg (around the year 1600). In our
1 CONT oldest church record book there is a hand written diary of thirteen
1 CONT pages by the Pastor Wolffhart covering the year 1664!
1 CONT Regarding Duehren the following may be said: it's a very old place!
1 CONT Archaeological remains from the pre-Christian era (celtic graves),
1 CONT excavation of a Roman villa that dates from 300 B.C., "villa Durmina"
1 CONT in 769 A.D., first church built in 827, Lutheran since 1552. There is
1 CONT a book of regional history concerning Duehren by Prof. Karl
1 CONT Schumacher, Ph.D., director of the Romano-Germanic Central Museum of
1 CONT Mainz. About fifteen houses four hundred years old are still standing
1 CONT here. The church was set afire in 1945 by fire from the American tanks
1 CONT and thereby destroyed. (Don't interpret this as a complaint).
1 CONT Nevertheless, the magnificent choir room from the year 1494 (Gothicc
1 CONT style of architecture) with all the valuable paintings on the ceiling
1 CONT that date from the same year are intact. In this Choir in 1681 Jost
1 CONT Schwab was married to his Anna Katharina.
1 CONT I remain at your disposition for further advice, to the degree that I
1 CONT can obtain such information for you, and remain with kindest regards,
1 CONT Yours,
1 CONT Gerhard Niemann, Pastor

1 CONT 7. In Gilbert E. Swope's History of the Swope Family and Their
1 CONT Connections, 1678-1896, the following document is printed. The book
1 CONT states that the original document was in the possession of Adam Swope
1 CONT of Lancaster, Pennsylvania when the book was published in 1896. This
1 CONT document does not match research done in Germany or the United States.
1 CONT Perhaps it was translated incorrectly; for this reason I would like
1 CONT very much to know where the original document is. Our Jost was a
1 CONT member of the Reformed Church, not the Lutheran Church; his wife's
1 CONT name was Anna Katharine, not his mother's name; his father's widow,
1 CONT Margaretha born Zimmerman [she could have been Jost's mother or his
1 CONT stepmother), died in 1695, twenty-five years before this document was
1 CONT written. Then who is the Jost Schwab of the document? Research in
1 CONT Germany appearing on page 1303 has found other Jost Schwab's living in
1 CONT the vicinity of Leimen at the same time that Jost and Anna Katharina
1 CONT Schwab were living there and having children there. The translation of
1 CONT the document as it appears in the History of the Swope Family is as
1 CONT follows:
1 CONT "Lectoria Salutino; or Pentalem Ammegemon a Salutis Oceana. After the
1 CONT death of her husband, a burger and burgomaster in Liemen under
1 CONT Burstrasser (Bergstrasse) in Kurpfalz, Anna Katharine Swope was
1 CONT delivered of her youngest son, Yost Swope (Jost Schwab). Both were
1 CONT Evangelical Lutheran in Religion, and received into the church of
1 CONT Christ with the rest of the beloved family. As they intend to depart
1 CONT for a strange land, I herewith attest to their Christian character and
1 CONT the life they led up to this time, having long been their pastor and
1 CONT spiritual adviser. As their fide pastorale, I willingly testify that
1 CONT the above named Anna Katharine and her beloved son, Yost (Jost), have
1 CONT always been honest and pious as becomes God-fearing Christians and
1 CONT lovers of Christ and his church. And we have no knowledge of them
1 CONT excepting what is noble and good, naught but praise. The All-Helper be
1 CONT their support and guide, and bless their coming and going, and grant
1 CONT all their wishes with the richest blessings, both on earth and in
1 CONT heaven, ever partaking of the Holy Communion.
1 CONT Leimen, Germany, May 5, 1720.
1 CONT M. John Christoph Schrenik, Pastor Evangelische Kirchengemeinde"
1 CONT Perhaps the Anna Catharina Schwab, widow of Jost Schwab, the mayor of
1 CONT Sandhausen who married Hanss Georg Bott, the 24 of June 1706 is the
1 CONT Anna Catharine Swope of the above document.* Were she and her son
1 CONT related to Jost and Anna Katharina (Wolfhardt) Schwab, and did they
1 CONT accompany them to America in May of 1720? To find the meaning of this
1 CONT document, research continues.
