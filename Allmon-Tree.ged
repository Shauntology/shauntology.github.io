1 CONC , NC. Per Francis Allman Beaver, had land next to son Richard in norther
1 CONC n Wake Co, NC in 1772/3(old Orange Co). Before Nathaniel, line was in Is
1 CONC le Of Wight County, VA.

1 CONT According to the Almon Branch Book in possession of Hudson Alexander, fo
1 CONC ur of Nathaniel's brothers went to old Anson County (now Richmond). Seve
1 CONC ral got involved in the Regulator Movement, which ultimately became gene
1 CONC rally unpopular. Many involved left the area, some changing their names
1 CONC . There was a Matthew born 16 Jun 1782 in that area, the son of a John A
1 CONC lmond. One of Nathaniel's brothers was named John. Matthew moved to Indi
1 CONC ana and is progenitor to the Almonds in IN & IA. The book "ALMON BRANC
1 CONC H SEEKING NEW FRONTIERS" was self published by Eddie Almon Redmon-Hillia
1 CONC rd and has 664 pages.
0 @N0150@ NOTE John 'Richard' Almond (also recorded as Allman).Richard was one o
1 CONC f four Almond brothers that moved to what is now northwestern Stanly Co
1 CONC . NC between 1785 and 1790.Richard, after a short time, moved slightly w
1 CONC estward to what is now Cabarrus Co. His brother Thomas later moved to In
1 CONC diana or Illinois .Brothers Edward and Nathan remained in what was the
1 CONC n Montgomery Co. These four brothers were sons of Nathaniel Almond (b. a
1 CONC bt. 1730-32) and Alsey Comaday of old Orange Co. NC (now extreme NW Wak
1 CONC e Co.). It appears that Nathaniel of Orange (there were many Nathan Almo
1 CONC nds named after him) had several brothers that moved southwesterly to a
1 CONC n area just east of the Pee Dee River that is present day Richmond Co. (
1 CONC was Anson then).Brothers were William, James, Edward, and John. It appea

1 CONT 
1 CONT I am not sure as to what exactly Peter Shoop Sr.’s correct birth year is
1 CONC . I have 1811 but it may well be 1801. According to what census one use
1 CONC s both would be correct and 1811 is closer to Nancy’s age. The tombston
1 CONC e from what I have seen in person and from the scan that Lois sent me, i
1 CONC s really hard to read.
1 CONT 
1 CONT In the 1850 census Peter Shoop and family are in Huston Twp. Blair Count
1 CONC y. I took some entries from the 1860 census and tried to pin point his l
1 CONC ocation with a map I have from Bedford in 1860. I am almost certain tha
1 CONC t the family was then living just south of what today is named Queen i
1 CONC n Kimmel Township in Bedford County. The 1870 census lists Peter Sr. an
1 CONC d William as living next to one another. A map I have from around that t
1 CONC ime shows them living on what is today SR4030. This is about 2 miles fro
1 CONC m where the Shoop graves are. It is my interpretation of what info I hav
1 CONC e that when the 1860 census was taken the family rented a farm in the Qu
1 CONC een area. Peter Jr. married into a family that lived close by Pleasentvi
1 CONC lle in 1861. Peter’s father-in-law , Samuel Clark, was involved with a c
1 CONC hurch ( Methodist) in the Lovely area. William and Ellen Shoop married M
1 CONC ocks; David and Rebecca married Corl’s. I am pretty sure that William
1 CONC ’s and Ellen’s Mocks were brother and sister. Catherine also married a M
1 CONC ock but I can’t fit him in anywhere as yet. Not sure if David and Rebecc
1 CONC a’s spouses were related. Besides showing possible relationships, this m
1 CONC eans to me that by 1861 or so the family had moved to near the border o
1 CONC f St. Clair and Union Twps.

1 CONT 
1 CONT The story below about the name-change is by Lucius Donkle Jr. and is sta
1 CONC ted as the family legend. Better genealogy has found Peter's parents t
1 CONC o be Danckel not Dunkel. The story below makes sense if you substitute "
1 CONC Danckel" for "Dunkel". FamilySearch.org shows Peter as the first of 11 c
1 CONC hildren of George Danckel (9 December 1769 - 3 April 1848, LJRH-YM7) bu
1 CONC t the only child with the last name of Donkle. All other children are li
1 CONC sted as Danckel's. If correct, the story below of Peter choosing to chan
1 CONC ge his name as the story describes makes sense, pending better evidence.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Another family legend is that everyone in the USA with spelling "Donkle
1 CONC " is related due to the unique source of that spelling. In support of th
1 CONC at hypothesis, the spelling "Donkle" does NOT appear in the US Census fo
1 CONC r 1800 or 1810 but first appears in the United States Census of 1820 a
1 CONC s Peter "Donkle" in Dauphin, Pennsylvania.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Source 2 - researched and recalled by Lucius Boardman Donkle Jr. circa 2
1 CONC 001 (Peter's great-grandson):
1 CONT In Pennsylvania Peter Donkle changed the family name from "Dunkel" (Dar
1 CONC k in German) to "Donkle". There was another "Dunkel" in town who used fo
1 CONC ul language, drank excessively, and was suspected of murder. Occasionall
1 CONC y , he got his mail mixed up with Peter's. Peter, a very pious man, want
1 CONC ed to disassociate himself as completely as possible from this evil Dunk
1 CONC el. So, he changed his name. On Peter's tomb stone in the cemetery in Ve
1 CONC rona, WI, it is spelled "Donkel". Peter's daughter-in-law, Martha Jane W
1 CONC hite Donkle, spoke often of the tombstone cutter's mistake and planned t
1 CONC o have it corrected, but never got around to it. The tombstones of his s
1 CONC ons, Edward, Henry, and William, are all spelled Donkle.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Peter and his wife, Lydia, originally came from Wilkes-Bare, PA., accord
1 CONC ing to family recollection. However, the "History of Verona" , publishe
1 CONC d as a centennial souvenir, says they came from Mercer County, PA. But
1 CONC , there is no record of their having been there.
1 CONT 
1 CONT The family came to Verona in a covered wagon in about 1835. At night the
1 CONC y camped and let the boys run about to use up energy, a relief after the
1 CONC ir being cramped in the wagon all day. After a few weeks, they arrived i
1 CONC n Verona where they built a one room log cabin, homesteaded land on Badg
1 CONC er Prairie, and started a new life. Their son Henry Donkle was only a ba
1 CONC by at the time. in addition to their three sons, they had five daughters
1 CONC .
1 CONT 
1 CONT Note: In June 2001, Lucius B. Donkle Jr. visited the Luzerne County Hist
1 CONC orical Society in Wilkes-Bare to see if any "Dunkel" birth or marriage r
1 CONC ecords could be found. A quick scan of microfilms for the 1830 census co
1 CONC vering Wilkes-Bare and the counties near it did not show any 'Dunkel's
1 CONC " or "Donkle's". However, the 1800 Pennsylvania Census did show severa
1 CONC l "Dunkle's" and "Wendling's" in the counties near Lancaster, PA. Lydi
1 CONC a Wendling was Peter Donkle's wife. So, it is possible, with a misspelli
1 CONC ng of "Dunkel", that this is the area where they met and married.
1 CONT 
1 CONT The Pennsylvania Census from 1800 to 1840 showed the following:
1 CONT 1800 - 0 Dunkel 12 - Dunkle
1 CONT 1810 - 2 Dunkel 22 - Dunkle
1 CONT 1820 - 0 Dunkel 27 - Dunkle
1 CONT 1830 - 10 Dunkel 35 - Dunkle
1 CONT 1840 - 8 Dunkel 47 - Dunkle
1 CONT The book " Pennsylvania German Immigrants 1709-1786" ( Published by Gene
1 CONC alogical Publishing Co. ) says
1 CONT 122 Germanic families emigrated in the period 1734-1752 from the Swiss C
1 CONC anton of Schaffhausen from Northcentral Switzerland, at the Falls of th
1 CONC e Rhine. Included were:
1 CONT Dunkel, Hans - village of Merishausen (1748) - To Pennsylvania with wif
1 CONC e and two sons.
1 CONT Dunkel, Melchoior - Village of Merishausen (1742) - To Pennsylvania wit
1 CONC h wife and children.
1 CONT Dunkel, Barbara - Village of Merishausen (1742) - To Pennsylvania
1 CONT 
1 CONT "in many cases names which do not appear in the emigrant lists turn up i
1 CONC n the registers of the Reformed Churches of Eastern Pennsylvania, as fo
1 CONC r instance the Bingolf, Demuth and DUNKEL families, which appear in th
1 CONC e records of the First Reformed Church, Lancaster, PA."
1 CONT 
1 CONT Unfortunately, at the time of writing this, nothing conclusive can be sa
1 CONC id as to where the Donkle's actually came from. But, speculation can eas
1 CONC ily lead to Switzerland and the area around Lancaster, PA.

1 CONT Three graves together (H-8702, H-8703, H-8704) were identified in the Bu

1 CONT 
1 CONT Triangulating different sources puts these men in the 63rd Indiana whic

1 CONC terred from a field hospital graveyard located 3.5 miles west of Pine Mt

1 CONT Thomas Allman Family History 1819 By Thomas M. Allman, et al
1 CONT 
1 CONT Thomas Allman was born in a town noted for its potteries which explain
1 CONC s why the town was known as Hanley, (commonly misspelled in Provo as Han
1 CONC dley), Staffordshire Potteries, England. Thomas lived there with his fat
1 CONC her, John Allman, and his mother Catherine Mollart Allman, his brothers
1 CONC , John William and four sisters, Mary, Sarah, Elizabeth and Dianah (or D
1 CONC inah). Thomas Allman was born 30 May 1819 and his sister, Mary 1818.
1 CONT 
1 CONT John Allman was a brick mason by trade and all his sons were brick mason
1 CONC s with the exception of Thomas who was a cabinetmaker. Thomas had learne
1 CONC d this trade by serving as an apprentice to William Hawkins of Hanley, S
1 CONC taffordshire, England for seven years. After serving his time he receive
1 CONC d his indenture papers as a cabinetmaker. John Allman was born about 178
1 CONC 0 in Shropshire, England, and his wife, Catherrine Mollart was born abou
1 CONC t 1789 in Burslem, Staffordshire, England. John was 60 years old when h
1 CONC e died on the 14 of February 1841. Catherine was 76 years when she die
1 CONC d the 11 February at her residence in Burslem at 5 Bond Street. Bursle
1 CONC m is a small city on the edge of Hanley.
1 CONT 
1 CONT When Thomas was 20 years old he fell in love and married his first wife
1 CONC , Prudence Mills., about 1839. Prudence Mills was born about 1821. The
1 CONC y had one child named John born 1840 in Hanley. Thomas and his wife join
1 CONC ed the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in 1841. In October 1
1 CONC 842 they desired to join the saints in America so they left Hanley for A
1 CONC merica and arrived seven weeks later in New Orleans, Louisiana after tra
1 CONC veling on a ship across the Atlantic Ocean. They left immediately for St
1 CONC . Louis, Missouri, where they had to spend the winter because the Missis
1 CONC sippi River was frozen. About the middle of April they left St. Louis o
1 CONC n the steamboat “Maid of Iowa” for Nauvoo, Illinois, traveling up the Mi
1 CONC ssissippi and arriving there the same spring.
1 CONT 
1 CONT On 31 May 1843 their second son, Reuben, was born. They were both very h
1 CONC appy with this event but Thomas came home from work one day to find tha
1 CONC t Prudence had passed away with her baby on her arm. She was only 20 yea
1 CONC rs old the 25 September 1843. Now he was a widower with two small childr
1 CONC en, and he was grief-stricken. However, the saints in Nauvoo were unite
1 CONC d and helped each other in time of trouble, so President Smoots' first w
1 CONC ife, Ma Smoot, took charge of the two small boys. The baby, Reuben, die
1 CONC d a few months later in 1844, and John, a young boy of six died later i
1 CONC n 1846.
1 CONT 
1 CONT On 5 October 1844 Thomas married a widow name Jane Walker Brull, and Eng
1 CONC lish convert who had nursed him through an illness. Apostle Willard Rich
1 CONC ards (ordained by Brigham Young 14 April 1840, performed the ceremony i
1 CONC n Nauvoo January. She was born in Worthington, Staffodshire, England, 1
1 CONC 2 March 1815. She joined the church and was baptized in October 1843. Sh
1 CONC e married her first husband, John Brull in October 1843 and left Englan
1 CONC d for America the same month. They arrived in Nauvoo 15 April 1844 wher
1 CONC e her husband died shortly thereafter. She was an eyewitness to the ligh
1 CONC t which shown over the Nauvoo Temple at the time it was dedicated. The c
1 CONC ornerstones of the temple were laid 6 April 1841, and it was publicly de
1 CONC dicated 30 April 1846. The baptismal font of the Nauvoo Temple was dedic
1 CONC ated 8 November 1841 by the Prophet Joseph Smith. It was a marble basi
1 CONC n upheld by marble oxen and was in use 4 years before the completion o
1 CONC f the Temple. Temple records show the endowments for the living were per
1 CONC formed from 10 December 1845 to 7 February 1845,
1 CONT 
1 CONT Thomas and Jane entered the Nauvoo Temple and received their endowment
1 CONC s 30 January 1846. They were living in Nauvoo when the Prophet Joseph Sm
1 CONC ith and Hyrum were assassinated and endured much suffering along with th
1 CONC e other saints. Thomas assisted in the building of the Nauvoo Temple an
1 CONC d did some work for the Prophet Joseph Smith. He built some carriages fo
1 CONC r the saints to use in crossing the plains. He built the carriage that s
1 CONC ister Hyrum Smith crossed the plains. He worked all winter and spring o
1 CONC f 1845 and 1846 making wagons for the pioneers of 1847 and all he receiv
1 CONC ed as pay was the running gears of a wagon without any iron on it whic
1 CONC h he sold for fifteen dollars.
1 CONT 
1 CONT During the winter Jane went to St. Louis and worked to be able to get so
1 CONC me groceries for them to live on. On the advice of Brother Joseph Youn
1 CONC g and others he went to Galena, Illinois, so he could get work and be ab
1 CONC le to get a wagon to travel to the valley. He got a job in a cabinet sho
1 CONC p and in a very short time he was promoted to foreman of the shop. He ha
1 CONC d made a beautiful piece of furniture which no other man in the shop wan
1 CONC ted to attempt to make. Townsend and Bash were the owners of the shop an
1 CONC d he discharged his son-in-law and gave Thomas the job of foreman. Ther
1 CONC e were 36 men working in the shop at the time. He held the position fo
1 CONC r 4 years and the owner offered to take him in as equal partner if he wo
1 CONC uld stay with them.
1 CONT 
1 CONT He declined this offer as he had left his native land for the gospel’s s
1 CONC ake and he had made up his mind to go to the valley and he would not sta
1 CONC y under any circumstances. He had a strong belief in the gospel of Jesu
1 CONC s Christ. During this time he had saved enough money to purchase a yok
1 CONC e of cattle and a yoke of cows, a wagon and the necessary things for th
1 CONC e trip across the plains. While living in Galena in the fall of 1846 th
1 CONC e cruel mob from Carthage came to Nauvoo where Jane was living and order
1 CONC ed her to cross the Mississippi River to Montrose where she would be saf
1 CONC e. She said to one of the mob, “If you will buy my cows and chickens I w
1 CONC ill go.” The man declined and told her “We will burn and mob all who d
1 CONC o not go.” She had no choice so Thomas sent her money to come to Galen
1 CONC a and she took her cows and chickens and an orphan boy she had taken t
1 CONC o raise. They lived there for 4 years.
1 CONT 
1 CONT On 22 April 1850 they left Galena in a wagon for Council Bluffs a distan
1 CONC ce of 600 miles. They had with them a yoke of cattle and a yoke of cows
1 CONC . They stayed there for one week before starting their journey across th
1 CONC e plains. They started their journey with the Aaron Johnson Company. Thi
1 CONC s company was divided into groups of 50 and 10 with Matthew Caldwell i
1 CONC n charge of their fifty and Thomas was made Captain of one of the group
1 CONC s of 10. They arrived in Salt Lake City on 9 October 1850, traveling fo
1 CONC r over 5 months. They lived there until 1856 where their daughter, Emm
1 CONC a Jane, was born 18 October 1853. He built himself a home in the Sixth W
1 CONC ard and was employed by the Public Works for several years. He worked o
1 CONC n the Salt Lake Tabernacle, the Beehive House, and the Lion House. He wo
1 CONC rked as a night watchman and policeman for 3 years. After the grasshoppe
1 CONC r war or famine, which was such a time of suffering for the saints, the
1 CONC y were all advised to raise their own wheat.
1 CONT 
1 CONT On 10 October 1856 he and his family moved to American Fork. He purchase
1 CONC d 110 acres of land and built a home. He put down the first well outsid
1 CONC e of the Fort in American Fork. He farmed 97 acres of the land and 13 ac
1 CONC res of hay. Thomas was called by Brigham Young to build the Meeting Hous
1 CONC e in American Fork. He worked on this and on the day the building was de
1 CONC dicated President Young called him to go to Provo to superintend the bui
1 CONC lding of the Meeting House there. In 1861 he moved to Provo. While livin
1 CONC g in American Fork he met Elmira Phillips who family had traveled from T
1 CONC oms River, Ocean County, New Jersey and arrived in Salt Lake City on 1
1 CONC 3 September 1861. Her father Richard Phillips and her mother Margaret Lu
1 CONC ker had a farm in American Fork. She was a very pretty young lady with b
1 CONC lue eyes and a profusion of nut brown hair, which she wore in ringlets
1 CONC , and Thomas immediately fell in love with this fair maiden. Thomas prop
1 CONC osed to her one night and of course he already had a wife, Jane and a da
1 CONC ughter Emma.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Since he was also 19 years older than she, Elmira couldn’t make up her m
1 CONC ind whether to accept the proposal or not. That night after retiring a w
1 CONC oman appeared and stood at the foot of her bed. She told her that she wa
1 CONC s to marry Thomas Allman as her mission in life was to be the mother o
1 CONC f his children. When she awoke the next morning she told Thomas she woul
1 CONC d marry him and of her experience of the night before. Thomas questione
1 CONC d her about the woman who had appeared to her and she described the woma
1 CONC n, Prudence Mills to him in detail. You have described her perfectly. (T
1 CONC his experience was related by Edwin Rusk Simons who heard his mother Mar
1 CONC y Ann Allman speak of it.)
1 CONT 
1 CONT Elmira did marry Thomas in the Endowment House in Salt Lake City on 21 F
1 CONC ebruary 1863 and had 11 children born unto them, 7 girls and 4 boys. Whi
1 CONC le in Provo Thomas superintended the building of the Meeting House or Ta
1 CONC bernacle he had charge of the building of the Provo Factory Building. Th
1 CONC e Provo Tabernacle was designed by Truman O. Angel, the same architect w
1 CONC ho designed the Salt Lake and St. George Temples. It was considered to b
1 CONC e one of the best meeting houses in the territory at that time.
1 CONT The pulpit was a wonderful piece of woodwork. The design itself was take
1 CONC n from a pulpit that President Brigham Young had seen in England. It wa
1 CONC s beautifully designed and the workmanship was so artistically done tha
1 CONC t it was truly a work of art. The entire building was beautifully done
1 CONC . The trusses in the roof were put together with hardwood pins and the t
1 CONC ower 80 ft. high had a 600 hundred pound bell which swung in it. Notwith
1 CONC standing the many years it stood, it was almost impossible to take it ap
1 CONC art. The Tabernacle was able to seat 1,300 people and answered their nee
1 CONC ds until 1883 when it was necessary to build a larger one.
1 CONT 
1 CONT The old meeting house was torn down in the 1919. The beautiful designs o
1 CONC n the ceiling and pulpit were done by Thomas. While in Provo he had char
1 CONC ge of a great deal of the carpenter work of the Provo Woolen Mills. He b
1 CONC uilt the first porch or veranda in Provo on President Brigham Young’s ho
1 CONC me which stood on the corner of 1st South and University. Emma Jane Allm
1 CONC an, the daughter, an only child of Thomas and Jane Walker Allman, his se
1 CONC cond wife, had her telegraph office in this building and was the first t
1 CONC elegraph operator in Provo. Jane Walker Allman, Emma’s mother, lived t
1 CONC o age of 88 years and died in Provo, Utah on 30 March 1903.
1 CONT 
1 CONT At one time someone suggested that Thomas Allman be sent on a mission fo
1 CONC r the church but Brigham Young said” “There is only one Allman in Utah a
1 CONC nd we need him here.” He lived in Provo from 1861 until 1876 when he wa
1 CONC s called by President Young to St. George to superintend the finishing (
1 CONC woodwork) of the St. George Temple. He returned to his home in Provo an
1 CONC d was called to Manti to work on the finishing of the temple there. He o
1 CONC beyed his call and left for Manti and built the altar’s woodwork and wor
1 CONC ked on the spiral staircase and did a great deal of the finest woodwor
1 CONC k in the temple. He was there about four years.
1 CONT 
1 CONT When he returned from Manti, he designed and built the framework for th
1 CONC e stand in the new Tabernacle in Provo. His health was very bad at thi
1 CONC s time having been stricken in June 1889 with gravel, a kidney trouble
1 CONC , from which he suffered a great deal. He died shortly thereafter on 2
1 CONC 2 July 1889 in Provo, Utah. His funeral services were held in the old ta
1 CONC bernacle which was largely attended and was buried in the Provo city cem
1 CONC etery.
1 CONT 
1 CONT He was First Counselor to Bishop J.P.R. Johnson of Provo First Ward f o
1 CONC r 26 years. Caroline Johnson served as President of the First Ward Relie
1 CONC f Society. Jane, Thomas’s second wife, and Mary Farrer served as First a
1 CONC nd Second Councilors. Jane, an excellent cook, kept boarders who were ac
1 CONC ademy students and many prominent citizens of the state such as” Willia
1 CONC m King, Joshua Greenwood and William Chipman of American Fork, Julian Gr
1 CONC iffin of Logan, James Paxman of Springville, and many others. Their daug
1 CONC hter, Emma, married Samuel Steven Jones a prominent citizen of Provo.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Elmira was the mother of 11 children and devoted most of her time to the
1 CONC m. Her avocation was nursing and she had great faith. She helped other
1 CONC s in throes of sickness and distress, even nursing one man back to healt
1 CONC h who had diphtheria. Thomas was often called upon to go out and adminis
1 CONC ter. Elmira had great faith—she always said the Lord would provide and H
1 CONC e did. Thomas worked hard carving and working in the Manti Temple, and a
1 CONC lthough an expert workman, he received only $5.00 a day. An ordinary car
1 CONC penter received from $2.00 to $5.00 per day.
1 CONT 
1 CONT At this time there were several small children in the family and they ne
1 CONC eded a cow. Thomas had inquired and had not succeeded in finding one fo
1 CONC r sale. Elmira prayed about it and then one morning she saw a cow lyin
1 CONC g near their gate and soon afterward a stranger came along. She inquire
1 CONC d about the cow and told of their needs and although reluctant to sell
1 CONC , he finally decided to do so and they got a good cow at a bargain.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Elmira’s home was built just 4 blocks east of the old one, a red brick h
1 CONC ouse with a large porch in front. She loved flowers and when the roses w
1 CONC ere in full bloom they formed a half circle around the lawn in front an
1 CONC d were very lovely. She had a comfortable home with a nice garden and fe
1 CONC w chickens. While living in Provo Thomas was appointed Captain of the se
1 CONC ttlement that sent men to meet Johnson’s army in Echo Canyon. Accordin
1 CONC g to his son Thomas Mollart Allman he was one of the most sincere Latter
1 CONC -day-Saints he had ever known. He is quoted as saying that his father Th
1 CONC omas took the last $10.00 he had up to the tithing office and paid it o
1 CONC n his tithing.
1 CONT 
1 CONT The following incidents were quoted by his son, Thomas M. Allman, was wo
1 CONC rking on a house in Manti, the architect and the owner were there and Jo
1 CONC seph Judd was also present to superintend the work and see that it was p
1 CONC roperly done. Joseph when introducing Thomas Mollart Allman, “He worke
1 CONC d for me on the Garfield Resort on Salt Lake, when he was a young man
1 CONC . I haven’t seen him since but I want to say to you, that I must thank t
1 CONC his man’s father (Thomas Allman) for what I know about woodwork. I worke
1 CONC d under him on the St. George Temple, and I am satisfied this man can d
1 CONC o the work, as his father was the best mechanic that ever graced the wes
1 CONC t.” Joseph Judd is the man that was in charge of the building of the “Sa
1 CONC lt Air Resort” on the Great Salt Lake.
1 CONT 
1 CONT In another incident an architect from New York was passing through Prov
1 CONC o saw the old meeting house and was so strongly impressed by it that h
1 CONC e went through the building. He remarked about the splendid condition o
1 CONC f the building after so many years of service of the splendid walls, an
1 CONC d the construction of the roof, tower, gallery, etc., and when he saw th
1 CONC e pulpit he said, “Well, there is one of the finest pieces of woodwor
1 CONC k I have ever seen. The splendid workmanship, the designs, and the artis
1 CONC tic manner in which this work was done is marvelous!” When he came throu
1 CONC gh Provo again, this beautiful building was torn down and destroyed. H
1 CONC e remarked, “What a shame it is that these old landmarks could not be pr
1 CONC eserved to house the relics of the pioneers."
1 CONT 
1 CONT Elmira Phillips and Thomas had the following children born to them: Mar
1 CONC y Ann born 26 Jun 1864, Prudella born 12 December 1865, Thomas Mollart b
1 CONC orn 4 April 1867, Levi William born 16 April 1869, Clara Valate born 5 M

1 CONC est grew to manhood and womanhood. All of these children were born in Pr

1 CONT Gregg is the younger son of Willis Turner Allman and Geraldine Alice (ne
1 CONC e Robbins) . He was born in Nashville Tennessee, thirteen months after h
1 CONC is brother Duane. His father was in the army and in 1949 the family relo
1 CONC cated to Fort Story, Norfolk, Virginia. Shortly after, his father was mu
1 CONC rdered by a casual acquaintance and Geraldine 'Mama A' Allman was left t
1 CONC o raise the boys. In order to retrain as an accountant, she sent her son
1 CONC s to Castle Heights Military Academy in Lebanon, Tennessee, which they b
1 CONC oth loathed. Eventually, in 1957, when his mother had finished her cours
1 CONC e, the family settled in Daytona Beach, Florida, and the boys attended S
1 CONC eabreeze High School.

1 CONT Both Duane and Gregg became captivated by music at a young age; Gregg ha
1 CONC s revealed that Duane and he went to see Jackie Wilson, Otis Redding, Pa
1 CONC tti Labelle and B.B. King perform and that he was particularly struck b
1 CONC y B.B.’s Hammond organ player. Gregg took an interest in the guitar befo
1 CONC re Duane did, learning the very basics from his grandmother’s neighbou
1 CONC r in Nashville. Duane would soon become the superior guitarist, giving u
1 CONC p school in tenth grade to focus on it while Gregg practiced his vocal
1 CONC s and keyboards, remained at school and finally graduated in 1965. Altho
1 CONC ugh he planned to become a dentist, Gregg fell in with his brother’s pla
1 CONC ns that they should become musicians, intending to go to medical schoo
1 CONC l after a short while; it didn’t happen.
