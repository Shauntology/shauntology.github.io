1 CONT 
1 CONT Thomas Allmon came to Marion County, Illinois from Tennessee, settled fi
1 CONC ve miles north of Salem. His wife was said to have been of Portuguese de
1 CONC scent. The story goes that the people at home in Tennessee received glow
1 CONC ing accounts of the fine country here in Illinois and the plentiful gam
1 CONC e which abounded but were skeptical of such reports. One old man said, "
1 CONC Well when Tommy writes back about the country we will get the truth." So
1 CONC on Tommy wrote telling how many deer could be seen grazing from the Hart
1 CONC land hill near where he had settled. But the old fellow shook his head a
1 CONC nd said, "Oh, he's just like all the rest now that he's moved out there.
1 CONC "
1 CONT 
1 CONT The story of Grandmother Allmon's nationality as remembered by her grand
1 CONC son, Michael Henry See, is that on one occasion when she told of her Por
1 CONC tuguese origin, a tipsy fellow over hearing the statement exclaimed, "
1 CONC A Ginni-gee by Gar." It is believed that she came from Pennsylvania, an
1 CONC d it is established that she spoke with an accent of some sort. She an
1 CONC d Thomas had a family of 15 children.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Grandfather brought a seedling peach with him from Tennessee. It was a l
1 CONC arge white cling, which became known as the Allmon peach. Later nurser
1 CONC y men tried to cross it with other varieties in order to get some colo
1 CONC r to it, but only succeeding in adding a faint pink, and we now know i
1 CONC t as the Heath Cling. Many people set out the peach, and Grandmother Jud
1 CONC y See had several trees, selling the fruit for as much as $3.00 a bushe
1 CONC l - not long after the Civil War - also getting the same price for a bus
1 CONC hel of black cherries.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Thomas Allmon had a horse mill where people brought corn to be ground. U
1 CONC ncle Thomas Smith of the Omega vicinity told of taking a grist to Allmon
1 CONC 's mill but was too late to get it ground that day, so many others wer
1 CONC e ahead of him. He had to stay overnight. The next morning early, Grandf
1 CONC ather called to the boys, "Hiram." "Yes, sir," responded Hiram instantly
1 CONC , and sprang out of bed, at once one after another, the other boys' fee
1 CONC t hit the floor; without a word all dressed and left for the barn and th
1 CONC e chores, and were seen no more until breakfast.
1 CONT 
1 CONT The family also had a lathe for wood turning and the boys made much of t
1 CONC heir furniture when they started their homes. Grandmother Allmon spent h
1 CONC er last years with her son, Jackson. One morning at breakfast as she wa
1 CONC s drinking a cup of coffee she was stricken with a stroke, but lived fo
1 CONC r a year, a bedridden invalid. Her daughter, Judith See, tried to driv
1 CONC e over to see her every month and Uncle Jack scarcely left the farm fo
1 CONC r any length of time during her long illness.

0 @N0149@ NOTE Death place likely to have been old Orange County formerly part o
1 CONC f Wake County, North Carolina, but now extreme southeastern part of Durh
1 CONC am County. Nortel facility now located on his former farm and no trace o
1 CONC f graves (per Lee Almond). Some sources says he died in Richmond County
1 CONC , NC. Per Francis Allman Beaver, had land next to son Richard in norther
1 CONC n Wake Co, NC in 1772/3(old Orange Co). Before Nathaniel, line was in Is
1 CONC le Of Wight County, VA.

1 CONT According to the Almon Branch Book in possession of Hudson Alexander, fo
1 CONC ur of Nathaniel's brothers went to old Anson County (now Richmond). Seve
1 CONC ral got involved in the Regulator Movement, which ultimately became gene
1 CONC rally unpopular. Many involved left the area, some changing their names
1 CONC . There was a Matthew born 16 Jun 1782 in that area, the son of a John A
1 CONC lmond. One of Nathaniel's brothers was named John. Matthew moved to Indi
1 CONC ana and is progenitor to the Almonds in IN & IA. The book "ALMON BRANC
1 CONC H SEEKING NEW FRONTIERS" was self published by Eddie Almon Redmon-Hillia
1 CONC rd and has 664 pages.
0 @N0150@ NOTE John 'Richard' Almond (also recorded as Allman).Richard was one o
1 CONC f four Almond brothers that moved to what is now northwestern Stanly Co
1 CONC . NC between 1785 and 1790.Richard, after a short time, moved slightly w
1 CONC estward to what is now Cabarrus Co. His brother Thomas later moved to In
1 CONC diana or Illinois .Brothers Edward and Nathan remained in what was the
1 CONC n Montgomery Co. These four brothers were sons of Nathaniel Almond (b. a
1 CONC bt. 1730-32) and Alsey Comaday of old Orange Co. NC (now extreme NW Wak
1 CONC e Co.). It appears that Nathaniel of Orange (there were many Nathan Almo
1 CONC nds named after him) had several brothers that moved southwesterly to a
1 CONC n area just east of the Pee Dee River that is present day Richmond Co. (
1 CONC was Anson then).Brothers were William, James, Edward, and John. It appea
1 CONC rs that John was a Quaker.

1 CONT Peter Shoop was a farmer who owned no property till after the civil war
1 CONC . Both wife Nancy and daughter Susanah Elizabeth were illiterate.
1 CONT 
1 CONT I am not sure as to what exactly Peter Shoop Sr.’s correct birth year is
1 CONC . I have 1811 but it may well be 1801. According to what census one use
1 CONC s both would be correct and 1811 is closer to Nancy’s age. The tombston
1 CONC e from what I have seen in person and from the scan that Lois sent me, i
1 CONC s really hard to read.
1 CONT 
1 CONT In the 1850 census Peter Shoop and family are in Huston Twp. Blair Count
1 CONC y. I took some entries from the 1860 census and tried to pin point his l
1 CONC ocation with a map I have from Bedford in 1860. I am almost certain tha
1 CONC t the family was then living just south of what today is named Queen i
1 CONC n Kimmel Township in Bedford County. The 1870 census lists Peter Sr. an
1 CONC d William as living next to one another. A map I have from around that t
1 CONC ime shows them living on what is today SR4030. This is about 2 miles fro
1 CONC m where the Shoop graves are. It is my interpretation of what info I hav
1 CONC e that when the 1860 census was taken the family rented a farm in the Qu
1 CONC een area. Peter Jr. married into a family that lived close by Pleasentvi
1 CONC lle in 1861. Peter’s father-in-law , Samuel Clark, was involved with a c
1 CONC hurch ( Methodist) in the Lovely area. William and Ellen Shoop married M
1 CONC ocks; David and Rebecca married Corl’s. I am pretty sure that William
1 CONC ’s and Ellen’s Mocks were brother and sister. Catherine also married a M
1 CONC ock but I can’t fit him in anywhere as yet. Not sure if David and Rebecc
1 CONC a’s spouses were related. Besides showing possible relationships, this m
1 CONC eans to me that by 1861 or so the family had moved to near the border o
1 CONC f St. Clair and Union Twps.

1 CONT 
1 CONT The story below about the name-change is by Lucius Donkle Jr. and is sta
1 CONC ted as the family legend. Better genealogy has found Peter's parents t
1 CONC o be Danckel not Dunkel. The story below makes sense if you substitute "
1 CONC Danckel" for "Dunkel". FamilySearch.org shows Peter as the first of 11 c
1 CONC hildren of George Danckel (9 December 1769 - 3 April 1848, LJRH-YM7) bu
1 CONC t the only child with the last name of Donkle. All other children are li
1 CONC sted as Danckel's. If correct, the story below of Peter choosing to chan
1 CONC ge his name as the story describes makes sense, pending better evidence.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Another family legend is that everyone in the USA with spelling "Donkle
1 CONC " is related due to the unique source of that spelling. In support of th
1 CONC at hypothesis, the spelling "Donkle" does NOT appear in the US Census fo
1 CONC r 1800 or 1810 but first appears in the United States Census of 1820 a
1 CONC s Peter "Donkle" in Dauphin, Pennsylvania.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Source 2 - researched and recalled by Lucius Boardman Donkle Jr. circa 2
1 CONC 001 (Peter's great-grandson):
1 CONT In Pennsylvania Peter Donkle changed the family name from "Dunkel" (Dar
1 CONC k in German) to "Donkle". There was another "Dunkel" in town who used fo
1 CONC ul language, drank excessively, and was suspected of murder. Occasionall
1 CONC y , he got his mail mixed up with Peter's. Peter, a very pious man, want
1 CONC ed to disassociate himself as completely as possible from this evil Dunk
1 CONC el. So, he changed his name. On Peter's tomb stone in the cemetery in Ve
1 CONC rona, WI, it is spelled "Donkel". Peter's daughter-in-law, Martha Jane W
1 CONC hite Donkle, spoke often of the tombstone cutter's mistake and planned t
1 CONC o have it corrected, but never got around to it. The tombstones of his s
1 CONC ons, Edward, Henry, and William, are all spelled Donkle.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Peter and his wife, Lydia, originally came from Wilkes-Bare, PA., accord
1 CONC ing to family recollection. However, the "History of Verona" , publishe
1 CONC d as a centennial souvenir, says they came from Mercer County, PA. But
1 CONC , there is no record of their having been there.
1 CONT 
1 CONT The family came to Verona in a covered wagon in about 1835. At night the
1 CONC y camped and let the boys run about to use up energy, a relief after the
1 CONC ir being cramped in the wagon all day. After a few weeks, they arrived i
1 CONC n Verona where they built a one room log cabin, homesteaded land on Badg
1 CONC er Prairie, and started a new life. Their son Henry Donkle was only a ba
1 CONC by at the time. in addition to their three sons, they had five daughters
1 CONC .
1 CONT 
1 CONT Note: In June 2001, Lucius B. Donkle Jr. visited the Luzerne County Hist
1 CONC orical Society in Wilkes-Bare to see if any "Dunkel" birth or marriage r
1 CONC ecords could be found. A quick scan of microfilms for the 1830 census co
1 CONC vering Wilkes-Bare and the counties near it did not show any 'Dunkel's
1 CONC " or "Donkle's". However, the 1800 Pennsylvania Census did show severa
1 CONC l "Dunkle's" and "Wendling's" in the counties near Lancaster, PA. Lydi
1 CONC a Wendling was Peter Donkle's wife. So, it is possible, with a misspelli
1 CONC ng of "Dunkel", that this is the area where they met and married.
1 CONT 
1 CONT The Pennsylvania Census from 1800 to 1840 showed the following:
1 CONT 1800 - 0 Dunkel 12 - Dunkle
1 CONT 1810 - 2 Dunkel 22 - Dunkle
1 CONT 1820 - 0 Dunkel 27 - Dunkle
1 CONT 1830 - 10 Dunkel 35 - Dunkle
1 CONT 1840 - 8 Dunkel 47 - Dunkle
1 CONT The book " Pennsylvania German Immigrants 1709-1786" ( Published by Gene
1 CONC alogical Publishing Co. ) says
1 CONT 122 Germanic families emigrated in the period 1734-1752 from the Swiss C
1 CONC anton of Schaffhausen from Northcentral Switzerland, at the Falls of th
1 CONC e Rhine. Included were:
1 CONT Dunkel, Hans - village of Merishausen (1748) - To Pennsylvania with wif
1 CONC e and two sons.
1 CONT Dunkel, Melchoior - Village of Merishausen (1742) - To Pennsylvania wit
1 CONC h wife and children.
1 CONT Dunkel, Barbara - Village of Merishausen (1742) - To Pennsylvania
1 CONT 
1 CONT "in many cases names which do not appear in the emigrant lists turn up i
1 CONC n the registers of the Reformed Churches of Eastern Pennsylvania, as fo
1 CONC r instance the Bingolf, Demuth and DUNKEL families, which appear in th
1 CONC e records of the First Reformed Church, Lancaster, PA."
1 CONT 
1 CONT Unfortunately, at the time of writing this, nothing conclusive can be sa
1 CONC id as to where the Donkle's actually came from. But, speculation can eas
1 CONC ily lead to Switzerland and the area around Lancaster, PA.

1 CONT Notes for EMMETT MAYNARD ALLMON:
1 CONT 
1 CONT From Phillip Allmon, grandson, Nov. 15, 2000:
1 CONT 
1 CONT "Emmett left Texas as a young man, courted and married Edith Knutson i
1 CONC n California, settled in the fertile but sparsely populated San Joaqui
1 CONC n Valley between Fresno and Visalia, CA. They owned a "four corners" gro
1 CONC cery store and gas pump situated diagonal on one corner, with nothing el
1 CONC se visible for miles in any direction. Their first child was my Aunt Fra
1 CONC ncine (still alive in Fresno), then Uncle Maynard (alive in Virginia), a
1 CONC nd my dad Warren (d. 1965). Although I knew Emmett as an old man, earlie
1 CONC r photos of him show he was an exceedingly handsome man. After he died
1 CONC , he was cremated and I believe his ashes were returned to Texas, so h
1 CONC e may very well be buried in the Allmon cemetery. From time to time he w
1 CONC ould drive out to Texas to visit the surviving Allmon clan but didn't sa
1 CONC y very much about his experiences. He was definitely a Texan - a man o
1 CONC f few words."

1 CONT 
1 CONT The name J. M. Brin, was on the original grave marker, is not listed i

1 CONC t Kennesaw Mt.
1 CONT

1 CONT 
1 CONT Three graves together (H-8702, H-8703, H-8704) were identified in the Bu
1 CONC rial Register as those of men of the 68th Indiana. However, the 68th IN
1 CONC D was not in the vicinity of Gilgal Church in June of 1864. The men's na
1 CONC mes were also incorrect: Brin is Brown, Nutt is McNutt, W. B. is Willia
1 CONC m Boulds.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Triangulating different sources puts these men in the 63rd Indiana whic
1 CONC h did lose 5 men killed and 11 wounded during the Battle of Gilgal Churc
1 CONC h according to the OR. Five buried at MNC: Jeremiah M. Brin/Brown (H8702
1 CONC ), John Q A Nutt/McNutt (H8703), William Boulds (H8704), James Penner (H
1 CONC 8748), John P. Jack (H8507). The 3 men buried near each other were re-in
1 CONC terred from a field hospital graveyard located 3.5 miles west of Pine Mt
1 CONC . J Jack is buried in H8507 not far away from the other 63rd IND soldier
1 CONC s but he was originally buried where he fell near Burnt Hickory Rd.
1 CONT 
1 CONT In August 2008, the VA received sufficient proof of the correct name an
1 CONC d replaced the grave marker.
1 CONT 
1 CONT H 8702 is located between:
1 CONT David Long, 100th Ohio, H 8701

1 CONT Both of whom were in the 23d Army Corps, 3d Division.

1 CONT Crossing the Etowah river and Pumkin [sic] Vine creek, it moved forwar
1 CONC d and went into an intrenched position on the Dallas line on the 26th, b
1 CONC ehind which the 63d lay, under fire of three batteries (the skirmish lin
1 CONC e being constantly and hotly engaged), until relieved on June 1. Its los
1 CONC s at this place was sixteen wounded.
1 CONT 
1 CONT After this it lay in line of battle from June 3 to June 6, behind work
1 CONC s of its own construction, losing one killed and one wounded. It was the
1 CONC n held in reserve until the 15th, when it was placed in the front line n
1 CONC ear Lost Mountain, losing six killed and eight wounded. On the 17th it m
1 CONC oved forward to the Kenesaw line, under a brisk fire, but without loss.

1 CONC harine Harsell Rich, 72 Terrace Rd, Walnut C reek, CA 94596: Joseph Rich
1 CONC , Sr. was a staunch Quaker to his death in 1757.  Onl y a hundred year
1 CONC s earlier, in 1654 in England, George Fox, with no inten t to create a n
1 CONC ew religion but merely to reform the existing one, ha d a revalation whi
1 CONC ch was the initial substance of Quakerism.  In th e beginning the Common
1 CONC wealth authorities considered the many convert s "puritan" as opposed t
1 CONC o "royalist" because both puritan and Quake r had aspects in common
1 CONC :  a passion for righteousness, a moral earnes tness, a stand against "n
1 CONC atural" pleasures and enjoyments of "the wor ld," opposition to fashion
1 CONC s and customs (which might foster loosenes s of life or personal pride o
1 CONC r selfishness), their conception of soci al proprieties.  Therefore, und
1 CONC er the Commonwealth, Quakerism had a c hance to get started; James Naylo
1 CONC r and Edward Burroughs and others wi th Fox were highly successful in th
1 CONC eir missionary labors.  But withi n a matter of six years, the same "pur
1 CONC itan" characteristics brought p uritan and Quaker into conflict.  Then b
1 CONC oth were persecuted when th e monarchy was restored.  Sometimes during t
1 CONC hat late 17th century o f persecutions, Joseph Rich was born and becam
1 CONC e a Quaker. Characteristic of Quakers from their beginning until 1730-
1 CONC 7 whe n a formal organization of the Society of Friends was made (with a
1 CONC n increasing organizational discipline and rigidity of thought) was inde
1 CONC pendence o f thought, as well as responsibility for personal action an
1 CONC d directio n by conscience. Thus JOSEPH RICH Sr. was a religious rebel
1 CONC , in tha t he maintained his right of individual direction and responsib
1 CONC ility. Perhaps when all is told, the commitment to individual convicti
1 CONC o n and the courage to act on that conviction are dominant Rich characte
1 CONC risti cs . These are evident over a much longer period of time in the hi
1 CONC stori c growth of the middle class to which the Rich family belongs.  Th
1 CONC e R iches and the families with whom they intermarried have been goers a

0 @N0437@ NOTE MICHAEL HENRY SEE V (1856-194O), SON OF HENRY SEE
1 CONT 
1 CONT Michael Henry See V was born in Marion County, Illinois, Omega Township
1 CONC , October 15, 1856, son of Henry and Judith Allmon See and grew to manho
1 CONC od in the same locality. At an early age he was converted and affiliate
1 CONC d with the Southern Methodist Church at Old Camp Ground where he faithfu
1 CONC lly served in various capacities.
1 CONT 
1 CONT In 1877 he was united in marriage with Sarah Ann Craig (1855-1889), daug
1 CONC hter of James (known as Uncle Jim) and Catherine Wilkinson Craig. They w
1 CONC ere the parents of five children: Myrtle (1880) who died at the age of t
1 CONC hree months, twin infants who died shortly after birth April 7, 1878, El
1 CONC lis Leroy, November 21, 1881 and Otis Elroy, July 2, 1883. Sarah Ann die
1 CONC d February 16, 1889 and is buried in Cockrell Cemetery southeast of Kinm
1 CONC undy, Illinois.
1 CONT 
1 CONT On October 23, 1891 Michael married Alice Harrell (1873-1944), daughte
1 CONC r of William James and Pachel Pless Harrell. In her autobiography Alic
1 CONC e indicates that her ancestors were English and Pennsylvania Dutch and t
1 CONC hat in her very early years she and her father had a very close, lovin
1 CONC g relationship. She states that "no one could see the shadow that hung o
1 CONC ver our house. The summer I was four years old my mother died, leaving m
1 CONC y sister, ten years old, my brother, two years old and I, too young to r
1 CONC ealize our great loss; but there was a great change soon evidenced in th
1 CONC e home . . . in less than a year a stepmother came to rule our home." Sh
1 CONC e states that her father went with her and Michael to the minister's hou
1 CONC se for the marriage ceremony.
1 CONT 
1 CONT According to Alice, Michael was patient, not quick to criticize, and sim
1 CONC ple in his manner of living. Money was never plentiful with the living c
1 CONC oming off the farm and occasionally he got some carpentering to do. He w
1 CONC as painstaking and conscientious in whatever work he engaged.
1 CONT 
1 CONT They were the parents of seven children: Irene Melba (1892), Eunice Velm
1 CONC a (1894), Hobart Harrell (1896), Edith Fern (1897), Winifred Elma (1900)
1 CONC , and twins Charlene and Georgia (1902). Georgia died at eight months o
1 CONC f age. They lived in a house near Michael's boyhood home until around 19
1 CONC 04 when Michael built a two story house on the land he had inherited fro
1 CONC m his parents. Alice often read to the children and a high priority wit
1 CONC h Michael and Alice was an education for their children.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Edith Fern See recalls that when she was a young child Uncle Jim Craig (
1 CONC Sarah Ann Craig See's father) would come to their house often and her mo
1 CONC ther, father and Uncle Jim would sit around and talk. One story Edith re
1 CONC members is a tale told by Uncle Jim. The Craig family came to Illinois f
1 CONC rom Kentucky when Jim was a young boy and the family traveled with the L
1 CONC incoln family; Nancy Hanks Lincoln was a relative of the Craigs. As the
1 CONC y came overland one mule was to be used by Jim and Abe Lincoln. Accordin
1 CONC g to the story Jim had to walk the distance as Abe would not share! Th
1 CONC e Craigs settled in Marion County and the Lincoln's went on north.
1 CONT 
1 CONT When Irene and Eunice were in high school they would room in the home o
1 CONC f a Kinmundy resident and then Michael and Alice would pay the room ren
1 CONC t with eggs, potatoes, beans and other garden items. The family had a te
1 CONC am of horses, Mae and Maude. Edith Fern tells the story that one time Ir
1 CONC ene stayed overnight with a friend in Kinmundy. The mother told Edith t
1 CONC o drive Mae to town but park the buggy at the Methodist Church on the hi
1 CONC ll and walk down-town and get Irene. She did not want Edith to cross th
1 CONC e railroad track with Mae and the buggy. Edith says she was nine years o
1 CONC ld at the time.
1 CONT 
1 CONT In 1912 Michael had the misfortune of having the scaffolding under him b
1 CONC reak while at work on the old Baptist Church in the southwest part of Ki
1 CONC nmundy. The fall injured his back and finally caused him to lose his eye
1 CONC sight. Around 1914 the family moved to Kinmundy and Michael transferre
1 CONC d his church membership to the Kinmundy Southern Methodist Church and wh
1 CONC en it terminated to the Methodist Episcopal Church. With this handicap h
1 CONC e was still able to make his own way about the streets of town and coul
1 CONC d find any business house in Kinmundy. For many years he made two dail
1 CONC y trips to the business district to get the mail and visit with the loca
1 CONC l gentlemen. During the winter months when walking was restricted by th
1 CONC e weather Alice would read the Bible, newspaper and books to Michael.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Hobart Harrell began preaching at the age of 18 and the writings of Alic
1 CONC e in her autobiography indicate that when our country entered the Worl
1 CONC d War Hobart "felt it his duty to God and as a patriot to volunteer." H
1 CONC e reported October 3, 1917 to Camp Grant and in May 1918 was sent to th
1 CONC e front lines. He fell in action August 8, 1918 by machine gun fire bein
1 CONC g one to answer a call for volunteers to wipe out a machine gun nest. H
1 CONC e died near Fismes, France. In 1931 Alice Harrell See was one of the man
1 CONC y Gold Star Mothers to travel to France to visit the grave of fallen son
1 CONC s.
1 CONT 
1 CONT In 1933 Buster, a brown and white fox terrier who was the pet of the chi
1 CONC ldren of Charlene See Miller, came to Kinmundy to live after her death
1 CONC . He became the constant companion of Michael See and made the daily tri
1 CONC ps to town. The man and his dog were inseparable.
1 CONT 
1 CONT In 1939 the big two story white house with two large porches burned an
1 CONC d many family treasures were lost. Michael and Alice moved into a hous
1 CONC e one block east of their first home in Kinmundy. Michael died January 2
1 CONC 9, 1940 and was buried in Evergreen Cemetery in Kinmundy, Illinois. Alic
1 CONC e Harrell See died October 28, 1944 and was interred at Evergreen Cemete

1 CONT Issued by Kinmundy Woman's Club, 1957
1 CONT 
1 CONT Mrs. Nancy Greenlee See came to Kinmundy Township in 1844 from Point Ple
1 CONC asant in Mason County Virginia (West Virginia since 1863). With her wer
1 CONC e two daughters, Jane, the eldest, and Elizabeth and her husband, Richar
1 CONC d Elred Shelton, and the three younger See boys. The widow of Michael Se
1 CONC e, Captain of the 106th Regular Virginia Militia of the War of 1812, sh
1 CONC e was left at thirty-three with nine children to rear; Shull Morris, Jan
1 CONC e, Elizabeth, Minerva, Frances, John, Henry, Michael and Frederick.
1 CONT 
1 CONT At an early age, Shull M. See began working on the Ohio River; later h
1 CONC e became a pilot for craft running to Cincinnati; John and Jane ran th
1 CONC e farm, and all the younger brothers, in time, worked on the river
1 CONC . . . "a-boating", as it was called.
1 CONT 
1 CONT In 1843, Stokes Prewett, his wife Minerva See and their four small child
1 CONC ren moved to Illinois, coming down the Ohio by flat boat to Shawneetown
1 CONC . He bought land, now belonging to J. W. McCulley and J. Hoyt, which joi
1 CONC ned that of his half-brother, Robert Pruett, whose house was just west o
1 CONC f the present Illinois Central Railroad reservoir. Minerva wrote her mot
1 CONC her of the fine land still available in the township at one dollar and t
1 CONC wenty-five cents an acre.
1 CONT 
1 CONT In March 1844, the family arrived and moved into a cabin northwest of Ev
1 CONC ergreen Cemetery rented from Harvey Gray and his mother, who had gone t
1 CONC o Tennessee to settle an estate. The boys farmed some of Robert Pruett'
1 CONC s land that first year. Their cornfield extended from the present Kinmun
1 CONC dy Methodist Church to a creek near the old Judge Snelling home. They, a
1 CONC lso, built a double-log cabin on their own land south of town . . . a ha
1 CONC lf-quarter mile from the Sheltons.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Shull M. See, his wife Mary Elizabeth Day and little son, Charles Michae
1 CONC l, followed the Prewetts' to Illinois. John See and young daughter, Susa
1 CONC n, came in 1846, soon after the death of his wife, Catherine Day. France
1 CONC s and Alexander Waugh were the last of the family to leave Mason County
1 CONC , settling near the others. After his wife's death, Alex Waugh moved wit
1 CONC h his children to Missouri. Mrs. Elsie Gee Alexander of Centralia is a g
1 CONC randdaughter.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Money in this new country was scarce and there was no way to earn any. M
1 CONC ichael and Frederick, in order to buy more land, decided to return to Vi
1 CONC rginia to work on the river. In mid-winter 1846, the two boys walked t
1 CONC o Odin in bitter weather to catch the stage for St. Louis to take a boa
1 CONC t for Pt. Pleasant. Michael returned after a year. Coming to Shawneetow
1 CONC n by boat, he walked the rest of the way home. His money in gold coins h
1 CONC ad worn through a thick leather wallet. Frederick remained in Virginia f
1 CONC or a number of years where he married Virginia Barnett. They moved wit
1 CONC h her people to Iowa. During the Civil War they joined the rest of the f
1 CONC amily in Marion County. Among their descendants here are: Mrs. Leona Se
1 CONC e Zimmer, Mrs. Edna See Telford, and Mrs. Hults Sipes.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Henry and Michael both married daughters of Thomas Allmon; this prominen
1 CONC t family of Tonti Township came from Tennessee in 1829. Henry's wife wa
1 CONC s Judith; Michael married the youngest, Elizabeth, who died at seventeen
1 CONC , leaving a son, Henry William See. In 1851 Michael married Nancy Jane C
1 CONC arrigan, daughter of Robert Mabane Carrigan, Marion County pioneer, an
1 CONC d brought her to the homestead, where their family has resided for mor
1 CONC e than one hundred years. The house built about 1860 is occupied by hi
1 CONC s youngest daughter, Miss Clara See and granddaughter, Mrs. Rhea White L
1 CONC owe.
1 CONT 
1 CONT John and Henry later took up land "across the prairie" in Omega Township
1 CONC . Here, Henry died in 1863 from an injury sustained while digging a well

1 CONC as not fond of Richard Burl (Dick) Pruitt when Maude started seeing hi

1 CONC lothing in some manner caught fire and before assistance could reach her
1 CONC , her body was enveloped in flames, the flesh was practically cooked i

1 CONT Mr. and Mrs. Hamilton lived in Tarrant County, about four miles north o
1 CONC f Azle. Wm. Hamilton had gone to Springtown to mill, and Mrs. Hamilton a
1 CONC nd some of her children were at the home alone. Mrs. Hamilton was weavin
1 CONC g on an old-time loom at her log cabin home in the edge of the timber, w
1 CONC hen several Indians took them by surprise. Several of the children wer
1 CONC e away. Wm. Hamilton Jr. was attending cattle, Mahala, Eliza, Samuel an
1 CONC d John were picking cotton. Sarina Myres, a step-child of Mr. Hamilton
1 CONC , and Mary and Gus, the infant children of Mr. and Mrs. Hamilton, were a
1 CONC t home with their mother. Mrs. Hamilton was murdered and her baby partl
1 CONC y scalped, but it lived a short time. Sarina Myres, and Mary Hamilton, h
1 CONC alf-sisters, were made prisoners. Feather beds were ripped open and th
1 CONC e house robbed of its contents. After traveling thirty or forty miles, t
1 CONC he Indians camped that night somewhere in Wise County. Little Mary Hamil
1 CONC ton had been having chills, so they wrapped her up warmly, and left he
1 CONC r alone in camp the next morning when the Indians rode away. But she cri
1 CONC ed so unmercifully, a warrior returned and murdered the little girl. Sar
1 CONC ina Myres was carried to Oklahoma, and kept in the vicinity of the prese

1 CONC ther, who brought her home.

1 CONT 
1 CONT =====
1 CONT 
1 CONT According to further research by Doyle Marshall, from the book, A Cry Un
1 CONC heard, the story is as follows:
1 CONT 
1 CONT The party left immediately with the captives for their camp in Indian Te
1 CONC rritory. Unlike most raiding parties in North Texas who, after committin
1 CONC g depredations, rode rapidly and continuously until they reached sanctua
1 CONC ry north of the Red River, the Kiowa band camped that night in Texas. Ne
1 CONC xt morning, while breaking camp, the warriors became concerned at the si
1 CONC ght of dust rising from the back trail. Fearing that they were being pur
1 CONC sued by the settlers, the party quickly started for the Red River. To ex
1 CONC pedite his escape the captor of Mary Hamleton left her, wrapped in a bla
1 CONC nket, at the campsite. When they soon found that the dust was caused b
1 CONC y a herd of stampeding cattle, the Kiowas relaxed their pace. Mary's cap
1 CONC tor told Hah-bay-te that he had left the child behind and alive. Hah-bay
1 CONC -te thereupon recovered her, took her to the Kiowa camp, and gave her t
1 CONC o this childless daughter.
1 CONT 
1 CONT An-pay-kau-te recalled that when brought into the Kiowa village and take
1 CONC n from Hah-bay-te's horse, the little blue-eyed, light haired captive wa
1 CONC s very lively and ran around camp. She was a happy, good-natured child a
1 CONC nd quickly learned to play with the Indian girls. However, some, when ol
1 CONC d, recalled that she had a temper, and, when angry, could "whip them all
1 CONC ." She readily learned to speak Kiowa and soon forgot her native tongue.
1 CONT 
1 CONT At first, Mary Hamleton was called Ta-han, meaning Texan, the most commo
1 CONC n name given to captives from Texas. After her adjustment to the savag
1 CONC e way of life and her acceptance by the Kiowas she was given the name, T
1 CONC o-goam-gat-ty, meaning, "the woman who holds the medicine, standing in t
1 CONC he rear of the tipi." She was, however, affectionately called "To-goam."
1 CONC The two other captive children, Sarina and Gus, were sold at a militar
1 CONC y post. When United States government officials inquired about the "othe
1 CONC r" child taken in the raid on the Hamleton home, the Kiowas replied tha
1 CONC t she had died.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Soon after her capture, To-goam went with her captors to the celebrate
1 CONC d Council of Medicine Lodge Creek, in southern Kansas, where on Octobe
1 CONC r 21, 1867 a treaty was made between the Comanches, Kiowas, and Kiowa-Ap
1 CONC aches and the United States. Most of the Kiowas went solely for the purp
1 CONC ose of receiving government annuities. The Kiowas had a good time at th
1 CONC e council, although, due to the language barrier, they seemed to underst
1 CONC and little of what was said. Two things, however, they did understand; t
1 CONC hey would be placed on a reservation near the Wichita Mountains, and al
1 CONC l their white captives must be surrendered. To avoid having to give up t
1 CONC heir beloved To-goam her foster parents hid the child out on the prairie
1 CONC -a safe distance from the eyes of the soldiers, newspaper reports, and g
1 CONC overnment officials.
1 CONT 
1 CONT To-goam was reared in a respected Kiowa family by a loving foster mother
1 CONC , Tope-kau-da (Oak Tree, or Acorn) and foster father, a warrior named Ta
1 CONC n-goodle, who died a few years after To-goam was taken into their care
1 CONC . To-goam provided much pleasure and companionship to her widowed foste
1 CONC r mother. The two were seldom separated until the leading male member o
1 CONC f Tope-kau-da's family selected a Mexican captive as a husband for the g
1 CONC irl. After her marriage To-goam often lay in her tipi and cried for he
1 CONC r foster mother, while lonely Tope-kau-da wept for her "special" child.
1 CONT 
1 CONT As a strong, large-framed young woman, To-goam excelled in horsemanship
1 CONC . When thrown, while breaking mustangs, she would cheerfully try again u
1 CONC ntil she succeeded. She was an expert at training and caring for horses
1 CONC . To-goam also excelled at swimming. When a fine horse, which was tied t
1 CONC o a tree on a rise was threatened by rising floodwaters, none of the you
1 CONC ng Kiowa men were willing to risk their lives by swimming the rushing wa
1 CONC ters to rescue the animal. To-goam put a knife between her teeth, jumpe
1 CONC d into the floodwaters, swam to the rise, and cut the terrified horse lo
1 CONC ose. The men were humiliated by her bravery, but they greatly respecte
1 CONC d her for the daring rescue.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Although To-goam developed into an envied Kiowa of exceptional strength
1 CONC , ability, and determination, her Caucasian features served as a sourc
1 CONC e of distress and humiliation to her. She lived in constant fear that, b
1 CONC ecause of her Anglo appearance, she might be discovered and taken from h
1 CONC er Kiowa people. Tope-kau-da had taught her to look down when in the pre
1 CONC sence of white people so that her blue eyes could not be seen. Consequen
1 CONC tly, most whites who saw her thought that she was a shy little Indian gi
1 CONC rl. During the winter of 1874-75, when the Kiowas were compounded in th
1 CONC e stone corral at Fort Sill, Tope-kau-da kept To-goam from being recogni
1 CONC zed as a white by painting her hair green, her face red, and keeping he
1 CONC r skin covered with a shawl. When officials several years later discover
1 CONC ed that To-goam was a white captive, she was the wife of a Mexican capti
1 CONC ve and had children of her own. They wisely left her with her adopted pe
1 CONC ople.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Although brought up in the religion of the Kiowas, To-goam was converte
1 CONC d to Christianity when the Baptist mission was established at Rainy Moun
1 CONC tain. Thus, her religious affiliation became the same as that of many o
1 CONC f the settlers in the area from whence she had been taken many years bef
1 CONC ore.
1 CONT 
1 CONT To-goam lived all but five of her sixty-two years as a Kiowa. She did no
1 CONC t remember her life as Mary Hamleton nor where in Texas she had lived. U
1 CONC pon her death on July 22, 1924, she was buried alongside her adopted peo
1 CONC ple in the Rainy Mountain Baptist Mission Cemetery. She was survived b
1 CONC y seven children and their many descendants, who considered themselves K
1 CONC iowas, although their mother was an Anglo and their father was a Mexican

1 CONT Jim Etter
1 CONT 
1 CONT DUNCAN - More than 135 years after being seized as a child in an India
1 CONC n raid, To-goam has rejoined her white relatives in Duncan.
1 CONT 
1 CONT She has joined them in a figurative, posthumous sense that describes Gai
1 CONC l Davis' jarring discovery about his ancestors and a violent era of Texa
1 CONC s and Oklahoma history.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Davis, a retired oil company engineer and native of Duncan, recently lea
1 CONC rned that his great-great-aunt was spirited away by warriors in 1867 aft
1 CONC er they stormed her family's log cabin in northern Texas and killed he
1 CONC r mother.
1 CONT 
1 CONT He also found that she spent the rest of her life - happily, apparentl
1 CONC y - as a Kiowa tribal member in Indian Territory and Oklahoma, and neve
1 CONC r knew her real identity.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Davis, 63, began his family research about three years ago after retirin
1 CONC g from Halliburton Energy Services. He uncovered documents showing tha
1 CONC t his distant relative was the same Mary Hamleton whose life story is re
1 CONC corded in history.
1 CONT 
1 CONT The saga of Mary Hamleton, whose Kiowa name was To-goam-gatty (meaning "
1 CONC woman who stands behind the tipi" and shortened to To-goam), is one of a
1 CONC t least three well-publicized cases involving captured children during t
1 CONC he 1800s in the region of Texas and Indian Territory - an ironic bit o
1 CONC f tenderness in a bloody, barbaric conflict between American Indians an
1 CONC d settlers.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Davis wondered about a remark he had often heard from his aunt, the lat
1 CONC e Opal Hunt of Duncan: "Whatever happened to the two little girls in ou
1 CONC r family taken by the Indians?"
1 CONT 
1 CONT After months poring over stacks of reading material and interviewing sou
1 CONC rces in two states, Davis learned about the raid on the home of Willia
1 CONC m and Sara Hamleton - and found they were his distant relatives.
1 CONT 
1 CONT 
1 CONT According to reports, it was a pretty day in April when about 60 painte
1 CONC d warriors, led by war chiefs Satank and Satanta, rode across the Red Ri
1 CONC ver from Indian Territory and stormed the Hamleton cabin, which was on W
1 CONC alnut Creek about 15 miles north of Fort Worth, Texas.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Inside were Sara Hamleton and three children - Lavina Myres, 11, Mary Ha
1 CONC mleton, about 5, and Gus Hamleton, 18 months. Lavina was a half-sister t
1 CONC o Mary and Gus. Sara had remarried after the death of her first husband
1 CONC , James Myres.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Sara's husband, William, was having corn milled at Springtown, 10 mile
1 CONC s away. Of the other children, William Myres, 16, was herding cattle; an
1 CONC d Mahala Emiline Myres, 15, Eliza Jane Myres, 13, Samuel Myres, 9, and J
1 CONC ohn Myres, 7, were working in a nearby field.
1 CONT 
1 CONT According to Davis' research, the Indian raiders, after killing Sara Ham
1 CONC leton and scalping both her and the baby, took Lavina Myres and Mary Ham
1 CONC leton with them. About six months later, Lavina Myres was returned to he
1 CONC r family by Army officials at Fort Arbuckle - apparently after being ran
1 CONC somed with horses or other goods. It was reported then that her younge
1 CONC r sister was dead.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Mary Hamleton, as To-goam, whose foster parents were the warrior Tan-goo
1 CONC dle and his wife, Tope-kau-da, grew up to be well respected within the t
1 CONC ribe, partly for her skill at training horses.
1 CONT 
1 CONT When she was about 17, she married Calisay, another captive. The coupl
1 CONC e had seven children. She lived for 57 years in the Kiowa village, abou
1 CONC t seven miles south of Mountain View, OK.
1 CONT 
1 CONT A climax of Davis' project has been visiting To-goam's grave in the Rain
1 CONC y Mountain Cemetery. She died July 22, 1924, about age 62, and is burie
1 CONC d alongside Calisay, who died June 4, 1923. Her name on the tombstone i
1 CONC s Tagonegatty - a slight misspelling, family members say.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Davis also has become friends with her grandson, George Tahbone of nearb
1 CONC y Mountain View, one of To-goam's closest living descendants.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Tahbone, 76, is a former member of the Kiowa Business Committee. He als
1 CONC o has researched the history of his white grandmother.
1 CONT 
1 CONT It's believed that To-goam quickly forgot English - and virtually all he
1 CONC r early white childhood - and for the rest of her life spoke only Kiow
1 CONC a and was at heart a pure Kiowa.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Tahbone, who like his grandmother and all her known descendants is on th
1 CONC e Kiowa rolls, believes his grandfather's name of Calisay came from hi
1 CONC s captors' mispronunciation of Carlos. It's believed he was very young w
1 CONC hen captured, possibly in Mexico.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Davis said he confirmed the relationship between his relatives and To-go
1 CONC am when he discovered family journals telling of the Indian raid - the
1 CONC n found proof in Tarrant County, Texas, court records.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Davis said he learned of atrocities on both sides in the war between th
1 CONC e Texans and Indians. He cited reports that a rancher, incensed by India
1 CONC n horse thieves, put a bounty on Indian scalps, which he hung on his fro
1 CONC nt porch.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Davis continues to study his family history. He doesn't know how far i
1 CONC t will take him, but he can hardly wait to get there.

1 CONT 
1 CONT THE KIOWA RAID OF WALNUT CREEK
1 CONT In April 1867 a band of about sixty Kiowa warriors raided the home of Wi
1 CONC lliam Hamleton on Walnut Creek in northwest Tarrant County. Finding Mr
1 CONC . Hamleton away from home at the time, they killed his wife and took a
1 CONC t least two of his children into captivity. The raid, not unlike many ot
1 CONC hers which took place in North Texas during the 1850's, 1860's and 1870'
1 CONC s, is however remarkable for at least two reasons.
1 CONT 
1 CONT First, one of the children, Mary Hamleton, remained with the Indians fo
1 CONC r the rest of her life, and second, there exists an interview transcrip
1 CONC t with one of the Kiowas who took part in the raid. Northwest Tarrant Co
1 CONC unty was still thinly settled in the fall of 1860 when James Myres, hi
1 CONC s wife and six children settled on Walnut Creek. Mrs. Sally Myres wa
1 CONC s a daughter of another nearby settler, Nathan Allman, who had recentl
1 CONC y arrived from Dallas County, Missouri. Mr. Myers died in the spring o
1 CONC f 186?, and in a short time Mrs. Myers married William Hamleton (Hamilto
1 CONC n). The Hamletons had two children after their marriage. By 1867, they w
1 CONC ere living in a comfortable two-room log house with a dog-trot, just nor
1 CONC th of Walnut Creek and a few miles north of present-day Azle. While th
1 CONC e Hamletons were readying their cotton crop in the spring of 1867, Kiow
1 CONC a chiefs Satank and Satanta were organizing a band to go south into Texa
1 CONC s from the reservation in present-day Oklahoma. They left their camp o
1 CONC n the North Fork of Red River, crossed the main stream of the Red Rive
1 CONC r at Doan's Store north of present day Vernon in Wilbarger County and
1 CONT passed near Fort Richardson. Somewhere in that area, one of the Indian
1 CONC s remembered, they found a single white man, killed him, and rode on. Fi
1 CONC nally they located a single log house in the edge of the timber just nor
1 CONC th of a large creek, a little west of the West Fork of the Trinity River
1 CONC . It was the Hamleton's house. On the day the Kiowas found his house, Mr
1 CONC . Hamleton was away at Springtown in Parker County to have some millin
1 CONC g done. His eldest step-son, William Myres, was also away tending cattle
1 CONC . Four of the other Myres children were working in the cotton fields. Sa
1 CONC rina Myres, aged eleven was in the house
1 CONT with her mother and the two Hamleton children, Mary, aged about five, an
1 CONC d Gus who was about 18 months old. When the door was opened by the India
1 CONC ns, Mrs. Hamleton was seated at her loom.
1 CONT 
1 CONT The Indians first attacked the older children in the fields, but they es
1 CONC caped. Next they attacked the house. An-pay-Kau-te, Satank's oldest so
1 CONC n remembered. Some of our men went up to the house and kicked in the doo
1 CONC r. There was a great big fat woman inside and some children. The woman t
1 CONC ried to defend herself, so we killed her. I don't remember how many chil
1 CONC dren there were in the house. We grabbed them and came out on the run.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Sait-aim-pay-toy had one girl captive, Ho-to-yeah had another. We rode b
1 CONC ack toward our
1 CONT country. The Indians took everything from the house which they wanted. T
1 CONC hat night they stopped to camp in a grove of trees. As they were breakin
1 CONC g camp the next morning, the Indians were startled by a cloud of dust ri
1 CONC sing behind them. They immediately thought it was a group of settlers wh
1 CONC o were trying to recover the lost children. Mary Hamleton, who was ill o
1 CONC n the day the riad came, had been wrapped in a blanket and secured so th
1 CONC at she could not unwrap herself. In their haste to leave, the Indian wh
1 CONC o had been carrying her threw her to the ground, thinking she would undu
1 CONC ly slow their flight. When the Indians discovered that the dust cloud wa
1 CONC s caused by a herd of cattle and not by a group of avenging Texans, th
1 CONC e Indians halted and Mary's captor returned to get her. Apparently at hi
1 CONC s time the group holding Sarina Myres separated from the rest, since Sar
1 CONC ina later remembered nothing of her younger sister after seeing her lef
1 CONC t on the ground rolled in her blanket. Sarina told her story after her r
1 CONC ecapture, and it was commonly assumed that Mary had died or was killed w

1 CONC ix months. Through the aid of a friendly Comanche named Asa Havey, she w
1 CONC as finally recovered at Fort Arbuckle from where her brother, William, e
1 CONC scorted her home. Sources disagree as to the fate of the youngest child
1 CONC , Gus. When questioned later by officials at the Kiowa agency, the Kiowa
1 CONC s swore that Mary Hamleton had been killed before she was thrown from th
1 CONC e raider's horse soon after her capture. In the face of this testimony
1 CONC , and because of Sarina Myres story as well, no further efforts were mad
1 CONC e to locate Mary. Mary Hamleton was not dead, however. The Indians wen
1 CONC t to great lengths for many years to hide her identity. Given to a warri
1 CONC or named Tan-Goodle and his wife, Tope-kau-da, she grew to womanhood an
1 CONC d married a Mexican captive named Ko-do-seet. As To-goam, Mary became a
1 CONC n accepted member of the Kiowas, and in later years was baptized into th
1 CONC e Baptist Church by J.J. Clous. When she died of a heart attack on Jul
1 CONC y 22, 1924, she was survived by two sons, five daughters and many grandc
1 CONC hildren. She was buried in Rainy Mountain Baptist Mission Cemetery in Ok
1 CONC lahoma. William Hamleton lived only about two years after the death of h
