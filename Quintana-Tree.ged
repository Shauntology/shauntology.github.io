1 CONT 
1 CONT It is with immense heartbreak that Winston and I announce the passing o
1 CONC f our dear mother Kitty Sam on April 29, 2021. Kitty was surrounded by h
1 CONC er family and passed away peacefully as her children held her hands an
1 CONC d prayed over her.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Kitty was born on February 2, 1947 to George and Ruth Leung in Canton, C
1 CONC hina. She spent most of her youth in Hong Kong, and immigrated to the Un
1 CONC ited States when she was a teenager. Her family initially settled down i
1 CONC n Fresno, CA.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Our mother was one of the most caring and kindest women to ever walk thi
1 CONC s earth and we were so blessed to be raised by her. Kitty was a wonderfu
1 CONC l and loving mother who gave her all to her family. She was our greates
1 CONC t motivator, greatest critic, but also our biggest fan. She always trie
1 CONC d to push us to realize our potential. We will never be able to fill th
1 CONC e space left behind by her.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Kitty was a woman who was strong in her Christian faith. She always remi
1 CONC nded us that God would provide us with everything we need. Her favorit
1 CONC e bible verse was Philippians 4:13, “I can do all things through Chris
1 CONC t who strengthens me.”
1 CONT 
1 CONT Kitty was passionate about gardening and when she wasn’t taking on a ne
1 CONC w house project, she could be found tending to the many fruits, herbs, a
1 CONC nd flowers in her garden.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Kitty was predeceased by her parents: George Leung and Ruth Lee Leung, a
1 CONC nd her two brothers: Tom and Woody Leung. She is survived by her two chi
1 CONC ldren: Winston and Tiffany; by her brothers: David and Samuel; and by he
1 CONC r sisters: Yan Oi, Yan Sum, May, and Esther. And along with all of her s
1 CONC urviving siblings, Kitty leaves behind many nieces, nephews, as well a
1 CONC s grand nieces and grand nephews. Lastly, she is also survived by her lo
1 CONC ngtime partner, Dennis, who has become a part of our family. One of th
1 CONC e greatest joys for Kitty was being able to spend time with her wonderfu
1 CONC l large family. She will be greatly missed by all of us.

1 CONT 
1 CONT Woody Yan Wood Leung, 63, of Spring Hill, Florida, went home to be wit
1 CONC h the Lord on January 10th, 2021. Woody was born in Hong Kong and move
1 CONC d to the United States when he was five years old. He was raised in a go
1 CONC dly home and grew up learning to put God and others first with a sense o
1 CONC f deep patriotism for our country, love for family, and a true servant'
1 CONC s heart.Â  He leaves behind his loving wife, Karen, of 35 years; his onl
1 CONC y son, Joel; daughter in law, Mary Anne; and three wonderful grandsons
1 CONC , Josiah, Jacob, and John.
1 CONT 
1 CONT He grew up in California with a large, loving family. He is survived b
1 CONC y five sisters, Kitty, Yan Oi, Yan Sum, May, and Esther; and two brother
1 CONC s, David and Sam. His parents and his brother, Tom passed on before him
1 CONC . He is also survived by many nieces, nephews, and great nieces and neph
1 CONC ews.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Woody was proud to serve as a Marine during the Vietnam Era. After servi
1 CONC ng in the military, he worked in the IT industry and was one of the firs
1 CONC t professional project managers to be certified as a PMP. Woody's giftin
1 CONC g as a project manager was evident in everything he did as he helped fam
1 CONC ily and friends tackle difficult problems with great ease. He used his g
1 CONC ifting in the churches that he was part of, as he loved to serve others
1 CONC . He was a man whose life truly reflected biblical values. He was steadf
1 CONC ast in his faith and had impeccable character.
1 CONT 
1 CONT He enjoyed his life to the fullest and spent a lot of time interacting w
1 CONC ith his grandsons and overseeing their lego projects and army men battle
1 CONC s. His life was cut too short but he lived it fully unto the Lord, lovin
1 CONC g his family and serving others. We know he is with the Lord now, full
1 CONC y healed, and full of joy. Though we do not have his presence with us, h
1 CONC e will always remain in our hearts. We look forward to seeing him agai
1 CONC n one day.
1 CONT 
1 CONT We will be planning a celebration of life service to honor Woody at a la
1 CONC ter date. In lieu of flowers, memorial donations may be made through th
1 CONC e Treasured Memories Memorial Fund to help cover the cost of his medica
1 CONC l expenses.

1 CONT In 1987 Rickey Darnell Owens killed two women volunteers at the Chines
1 CONC e for Christ Church in Rosemead. He initially fled to Mexico but was cap
1 CONC tured when he re-entered the United States the next day.
1 CONT 
1 CONT When asked at the border if he was wanted for any crimes, Owens admitte
1 CONC d killing the two women and Carrillo and his partner drove down to Mexic
1 CONC o to pick him up.
1 CONT 
1 CONT Owens promised to explain what happened if they would get him a burger
1 CONC . The lure of a burger was so strong, that Owens not only confessed to t
1 CONC he brutal slayings, but he re-enacted the crime at the church while dete
1 CONC ctives shot a video.
1 CONT 
1 CONT When asked why he killed the women, Owens explained he was high on cocai
1 CONC ne and blamed it for his failures in life. Ultimately Owens pleaded guil
1 CONC ty.
1 CONT 
1 CONT “All it took was that burger,” Carrillo said.

1 CONC peared in the census in 1790 in South Haven, Brookhaven, Suffolk, NY.  H
1 CONC e a ppeared in the census in 1800 in South Haven, Brookhaven, Suffolk, N
1 CONC Y. In the 1800 census he was recorded as Mordeca Homan. Based on neighbo
1 CONC rs in the list, it is likely he was living in South Haven or Fire Place
1 CONC . Adjacent in the listing were John and David Homan. Recorded in Mordeca
1 CONC i's household were one male under 10 years of age (probably son Silas)
1 CONC , and one male of age 26-45 (probably Mordecai), four females under ag
1 CONC e ten, one female 10-16, and one female of age 26-45. He appea red in th

1 CONC e aged 16 through 25, and one female aged 45 and over. He appeared in th

1 CONC .  In the household were one male to 10 year s, one male 16 to 26, thre

1 CONC 6 to 45. Five persons were engaged in agriculture. He died on 6 Apr 182

1 CONT While Yaphank has a history and Brookhaven Town a record, the name of Mo
1 CONC rdecai Homan will form a prominent feature in both.
1 CONT He was the most popular and illustrious Homan and citi zen that ever liv
1 CONC ed in Yaphank ; he was a sagacious poli tician, of keen penetration an
1 CONC d judgment, a discerning and judicious business man, and a noble and muc
1 CONC h-loved citi zen.
1 CONT No man was better acquainted with the history of his day and town than h
1 CONC e ; for forty-two years he was Town Clerk, a responsible and trusted off
1 CONC icer.
1 CONT When age laid its unrelenting hand upon him, and in firmities forced hi
1 CONC m to lay aside the quill forever, it was a lamented period in Brookhaven
1 CONC . The old veteran laid down his harness with a sigh. Long years had he b
1 CONC een the social friend and adviser of public men; long years had he bee
1 CONC n a faithful servant and an honorable leader.
1 CONT During all the years of his public life, not a murmur was spoken agains
1 CONC t him. No one doubted ' Squire Homan' s racity and honor ; no one questi
1 CONC oned what he discharged. When his eyes grew dim and his steps tottering
1 CONC , he bade farewell to a busy life, lived to see a successor establishe
1 CONC d and then girded on his armor for the long, long march of his fathers.
1 CONT When the cruel grave closed over him, and the mourning ones turned towar
1 CONC d the home made sad by the Angel of Death, a soothing consolation cheere
1 CONC d every heart, and mitigated the deep sorrow ; he had left a spotless re
1 CONC cord, a white rose of a blameless life behind him.
1 CONT Those who had differed with him politically, dropped a tear over his gra
1 CONC ve. The bad, bold politician, feared, but loved him. When he died the su
1 CONC n set over a sorrowing people.
1 CONT His life was a martyrdom of care and trouble. A large family of ailing r
1 CONC elatives depended upon him for the things of life, and hundreds of dolla
1 CONC rs went to alleviate physicians' demands. With but few to assist and man
1 CONC y to pull down, he still trudged manfully on, and reared a snug fortun
1 CONC e and an enviable name.
1 CONT From boyhood to ripe old age he carried that ambitious and business-lik
1 CONC e air. He was truly a self-made man, and erected the pillars of his succ
1 CONC ess. He was born of plebeian parentage, and no golden spoon held daint
1 CONC y morsels to soothe his childish whims. No wealthy relatives or finan ci
1 CONC al king placed him in public favor, or assisted in sus taining his reput
1 CONC ation.
1 CONT During the most seditious and tumultuous political times, when the trust
1 CONC ed and tried party men were abused and crushed by a people who had los
1 CONC t confidence in them, Esquire Homan was among the few who ran the gauntl
1 CONC ets unabused, and passed the ordeals unscathed.
1 CONT There were no Camerons, no Wades, no Butlers or Sum- ners in his day ; a
1 CONC nd he lived before the men of Morrissey stamp became honorables and nati
1 CONC onal dictators.  Early in life he taught school and labored upon his far
1 CONC m. He lived with his father upon his farm at Middle Island during his yo
1 CONC unger days.
1 CONT When about twenty-eight years old, he married a Miss Polly Buckingham, i
1 CONC n Old Milfred, Conn., and purchasing his brother's interest in the " Hom
1 CONC an estate," at Yaphank, moved thither.
1 CONT He evinced original ability, and his appreciating towns men soon electe
1 CONC d him a Justice of the Peace. In consumma tion, Esquire Homan officiate
1 CONC d in nearly every town office.
1 CONT In the days of his glory, his many friends were enthusi astically in fav
1 CONC or of his accepting the nomination for Assem bly. That nomination, and t
1 CONC he proffered one for Super visor, he decidedly refused. He was, withou
1 CONC t doubt, the strongest candidate for either position in the town, at tha

1 CONT == Biography == 
1 CONT Ralph Dayton. Born ca 1588 at Kent, England. Ralph died at Southampton
1 CONC , Long Island between 25 Jul and 22 Sep 1658.
1 CONT Ralph, was of Ashford, Kent, England, when he married Alice, and remaine
1 CONC d there for at least twenty years before coming to New England. He was p
1 CONC robably not in New Haven in 1639, but he drew his lot for the small lot
1 CONC s on the bank side and by the west creek on 17 Mar 1641/2. He took the o
1 CONC ath of fidelity 5 Aug 1647. By 1650 he settled in East Hampton, Long Isl
1 CONC and. There he was appointed agent to the Connecticut Colony in 1651. H
1 CONC e was also chosen for constable 7 Oct 1651. Not long before his death, R
1 CONC alph moved from East Hampton with his son Samuel to Southampton, where h
1 CONC is will was recorded, 25 Jul 1658, settling at North Sea, then called No
1 CONC rthampton, and leaving his son Robert on the East Hampton realty which h
1 CONC e had conveyed to him in 1655.
1 CONT On 16 Jun 1609 Ralph first married Alice Goldhatch, daughter of Robert G
1 CONC oldhatch (ca 1557-Jan 1597/8) & Bennett Meade (-ca 1 Dec 1638), at Ashfo
1 CONC rd, Kent.5 Born ca 1587 at Kent, England. Alice was baptized in Ashford
1 CONC , Kent on 24 Sep 1587. Alice died before 1655.
1 CONT Alice (Goldhatch) (Tritton) Dayton, widow of Daniel Tritton. Alice's mot
1 CONC her, widow Bennett (Meade) Goldhatch, had married Daniel's father, Hug

1 CONT === Notes ===Drew his lot for small lots in New Haven on Mar 17, 1641/2
1 CONC .  Took the oath of fidelity on Aug. 7, 1647. Moved to East Hampton, N
1 CONC Y by 1650. Appointed agent for Connecticut in 1651. Chosen constable o
1 CONC n Oct. 7, 1651.
1 CONT 
1 CONT === Immigration ===Ralph Dayton's stepdaughter Bennett Tritton Stanley e
1 CONC migrated to New England with Thomas Stanley in 1634. It is not clear exa
1 CONC ctly when Ralph and his family came over. Ralph is first mentioned in a
1 CONC n American record in 1639 when he signed (as Ralph Dayghton) the book o
1 CONC f the Fundamental Agreement of the New Haven Planters. However, he was n
1 CONC ot there for the original signing on June 4, 1639. 
1 CONT 
1 CONT === Occupation ===Ralph Dayton was a shoemaker by trade. In the econom
1 CONC y of that period, skilled tradesmen were essential members of the commun
1 CONC ity and were welcomed in the pioneer settlements by the ministers and me
1 CONC rchants who organized the first settlers. In 1647 he was appointed wit
1 CONC h two other shoemakers to test the shoes made by a fourth shoemaker whos
1 CONC e work had caused complaints.
1 CONT 
1 CONT === Religion ===Ralph is listed on 10 March 1646/1647 as having a seat i
1 CONC n the New Haven meeting house. His wife Alice is not listed, but it is u
1 CONC nclear whether she was dead or not a member. (Her daughter Alice never j
1 CONC oined the church so it seems possible her mother may have simply not joi
1 CONC ned.)
1 CONT 
1 CONT === Residence ===Ralph Dayton drew for lots on 17 March 1641/1642 and re
1 CONC ceived small lots on the bank side and by the west creek. He took the oa
1 CONC th of fidelity 5 August 1647. Around this time, he asked for a little la
1 CONC nd near his house lot, and also had a difference with a neighbor arbitra
1 CONC ted. On 3 April 1649, the Court was asked to settle a dispute about lan
1 CONC d in New Haven that Ralph Dayton had bought of Richard Platt. 
1 CONT But by 1650 Ralph had settled in East Hampton, Long Island. Since he wa
1 CONC s over 60 at this time, this move may have been instigated by his son-in
1 CONC -law Thomas Baker, husband of his daughter Alice. He was chosen as Const
1 CONC able on 7 October 1651.
1 CONT On 13 February 1654/1655, Ralph gave land to his son Robert, reserving l
1 CONC ife use to himself and his wife. The wife then living, whether Alice o
1 CONC r another, did not long survive, since the widow Mary Haynes became hi
1 CONC s wife a little over a year later.
1 CONT Ralph Dayton's will was recorded at Southampton, so it is likely Ralph h
1 CONC ad moved with his son Samuel, settling at North Sea, then called Northam
1 CONC pton, and leaving his son Robert on the East Hampton property which he h
1 CONC ad conveyed to him in 1655. 
1 CONT 
1 CONT === Family ===Four of his children are mentioned in American records an
1 CONC d in his will. However, his eldest son, Ralph Jr., is never mentioned. R
1 CONC alph Jr. would have been 21 in 1639 and possibly married and stayed in E
1 CONC ngland. 
1 CONT Ralph's will, dated 25 July 1658, gave his wife Mary 60 pounds sterling
1 CONC , mentioning the "land at Southold which was her owne." His son Samuel w
1 CONC as to have the house and land at Northampton and certain tools and a hor
1 CONC se. His son Robert was to have specified articles. He mentions "my daugh
1 CONC ter Baker" and gave to "my sonn Baker" 20 pounds, and to "my son brinlye
1 CONC 's children" 20 pounds to be equally divided between them. The will wa
1 CONC s approved 22 September 1658 and it was mentioned that Robert Dayton owe
1 CONC d his father 10 pounds. It appears his daughter Alice was living at th
1 CONC e time, but his daughter Ellen must have already died.

1 CONC n Dayton seems to be an extremely well researched and documented histor
1 CONC y of the early Daytons.  In it they come to the conclusion that Sam's fi
1 CONC rst wife and the mother of his first six children was probably not a Nat
1 CONC ive American.  They state that there is no evidence to support it and th
1 CONC at "...no serious genealogist seems willing to defend the story in thei
1 CONC r writing."
1 CONT They do quote Edson C. Dayton's 1931 'Genealogical and Biographical Acco
1 CONC unt...':::"There is a tradition of a fourth wife, named Wihelmina, and t
1 CONC hat she had Mohawk blood.  I have no authority... to substantiate this t
1 CONC radition."
1 CONT They cite only one record that names Sam's first wife which only gives t
1 CONC he name "Medlin Dayton".  Her parents, place of birth, where and when th
1 CONC ey married are unknown.

1 CONC .  This originates apparently from the "History of Salem, Massachusetts

1 CONT However, this speculation is undone by an earlier entry for [[Ingersoll-
1 CONC 4|Richard Ingersoll]], the first husband of [[Langley-63|Anne or Agnes L
1 CONC angley]] on page 131 of "History of Salem".  Ingersoll married Anne (o
1 CONC r Agnes) Langley 10 Oct 1611 (see her profile, History of Salem gave 2
1 CONC 0 Oct 1616 as the date) in  England and they had 7 known children.  The
1 CONC y immigrated on the "Anne" and the passenger lists includes no "Mary" (a
1 CONC lthough it does include Alice from Ingersoll's first marriage).
1 CONT Richard died in 1644 and Anne did not marry John Knight until after tha
1 CONC t date when she was likely well into her 50s.  So given that James Hind
1 CONC s and his wife Mary were already married by 1638, and given that none o
1 CONC f the 7 children of Richard Ingersoll and Anne Langley were named "Mary"
1 CONC , it would seem that Mary, wife of James Hinds, was NOT a daughter of An
1 CONC ne Langley Ingersoll Knight unless Anne was married, had a child, and wa
1 CONC s widowed in England before her 1611 marriage to Ingersoll.
1 CONT Further note that Mary Unknown Hinds does not seem to be a daughter of J
1 CONC ohn Knight and step-daughter of Anne Langley, the children of John Knigh
1 CONC t are known and are listed in his will.  He did have a daughter Mary bu
1 CONC t she was far too young to be the wife of James Hinds and was married t
1 CONC o a man named "Dowser" by the time of John Knight's will.

1 CONT === Two Sons John ===
1 CONT John Jr. and Ann Woodruff had two sons named John, generally called [[Wo
1 CONC odruff-334|"the elder"]] and [[Woodruff-333|"the younger"]]. This is app
1 CONC arently because John Gosmer, John Jr.'s step-father, adopted the first s
1 CONC on John and it was expected that he would take the Gosmer surname. The W
1 CONC oodruffs named the younger son John so that John Jr. would still hav
1 CONC e a namesake. But in 1659 Gosmer deeded all of his property to "my adopt
1 CONC ed sone John Woodruf who hath lived with me from a child". So the elde
1 CONC r John, then 22, had retained the Woodruff name and hence the duplicatio
1 CONC n.
1 CONT While it has been suggested that John the younger was the adopted son,<r
1 CONC ef>Francis E. Woodruff, <i>Woodruffs of New Jersey</i> (New York: Grafto
1 CONC n Press: 1909), p. 17. [https://archive.org/details/woodruffsofnewje00wo
1 CONC od/page/16/mode/2up Archive.org].</ref> Ceylon Woodruff argues that th
1 CONC e wording of the deed ("lived with me from a child") indicates referenc
1 CONC e to the elder: "It is unlikely that this language would have been use
1 CONC d to describe the younger John<sup>2</sup>, then only about nine years o
1 CONC ld and still a child. The deed likewise makes no mention of a guardian
1 CONC , who would have been appointed for a minor." Also, John the elder sol
1 CONC d off considerable real estate in Southampton in 1665 prior to relocatio
1 CONC n to New Jersey. This was presumably property received from Gorman. An
1 CONC d this interpretation makes sense of the fact that John the younger rece
1 CONC ived the bulk of their father's estate in 1670, the elder having been pr
1 CONC eviously provided for. <ref>Ceylon Newton Woodruff, <i>Woodruff chronicl

1 CONT === Notes ===: Note <span id='N15060'>N15060</span>Will of John Woodruff
1 CONC , Southampton, L. I.: In his will he gave unto his "Eldest son John Wood
1 CONC ruff of Elizabeth Town, one half crowne piece of money in full of all po
1 CONC rtions and Patrimony whatsoever, to be expected from mee, or out of an
1 CONC y part of my estate"; and to his daughters, Anne and Elizabeth, each £20
1 CONC , to be paid after the widow's death. These small legacies usually indic
1 CONC ated that the heirs concerned had already received their portions, on th
1 CONC eir marriage or their going out into the world, but the peculiar and par
1 CONC ticular wording in the case of the eldest son may perhaps mean that fami
1 CONC ly friction was not entirely avoided when the younger brother was adopte
1 CONC d as son, and made heir, by the step-grandfather. The testator further m
1 CONC ade the "wife Anne Woodruff and my youngest son John Woodruffjoynt Execu
1 CONC tors"; and left "all the rest of my Estate both land and chattels and go
1 CONC ods and household stuffe to be to ye only proper behoofe and benefitt o
1 CONC f my said Execs." By the Inventory attached to the will we further kno
1 CONC w that there had already been "one half of ye Land Howsings and Accommod
1 CONC ations clearly by Deed of Gift disposed of to his son John"; obviously t
1 CONC he younger son. (Search has failed to find the Deed.)  Witnesses were Ch
1 CONC ristopher Foster, John Laughton.

1 CONC y son of John Woodruffe, 1574-1611, of St. Mary Northgate, having by th
1 CONC e remarriage of his mother, Elizabeth, become the stepson of Mr. John Go
1 CONC smer, of Fordwich, returned with his mother to that parish, where, at th
1 CONC e age of 32, he served as churchwarden; but in 1637 his son (John) was b
1 CONC aptized in the Parish of Sturry, within half a mile of Fordwich. He marr
1 CONC ied Anne, who was possibly, as has been suggested, a daughter of the ste
1 CONC pfather by a first wife; but it is also possible that when, in 1665, the
1 CONC ir son John spoke of Mr. Gosmer as his "grandfather," it was not becaus
1 CONC e of his mother's parentage, but because through his father he was a ste
1 CONC p-grandson.
1 CONT : Thompson, on page 207, named among the settlers who arrived at Southam
1 CONC pton, Long Island, during the first twelve months, 1640-41, a "John Gosm
1 CONC an" (written "John Gosmer" on page 208) and a "John Woodruff"; while th
1 CONC e pages of the Southampton Town Records show that this only one adult Jo
1 CONC hn Woodruff of the period in Southampton was a member of the Gosmer hous
1 CONC ehold. In addition, this John Woodruff had a son John and daughters Ann
1 CONC e and Elizabeth; names of Woodruff-Gosmer parents and grandparents. 
1 CONT It is, therefore, only reasonable to presume that it was the John Woodru
1 CONC ff born in 1604 who accompanied his mother. Elizabeth, and his stepfathe
1 CONC r on their journey to Lynn and Southampton in 1639-40, and so became th
1 CONC e immigrant ancestor of the New Jersey Woodruffs. With him came his wif
1 CONC e Anne and the baby John, destined to later become one of the founders o
1 CONC f Elizabethtown, New Jersey, so that the baby's descendants enjoy the di
1 CONC stinction of having two immigrant ancestors.
1 CONT : For years after the founding of Southampton, although the land was "ho
1 CONC norably purchased of its original owners, yet the settlers never saw a m
1 CONC oment's rest for fear of their dreaded neighbors. In the field a guard w
1 CONC as kept; at night none knew at what hour the alarm would sound; to meeti
1 CONC ng, on the Lord's Day, they went as men prepared for instant war; ever
1 CONC y male, from 16 years of age to 60 was enrolled in the ranks." Under suc
1 CONC h circumstances it might be expected that the stepson and his wife woul
1 CONC d live with their parents, both no longer young, and the belief is confi
1 CONC rmed by Mr. Gosmer's statement (in the deed that was his will) that thei
1 CONC r younger son, John, born in Southampton, whom he adopted, "hath lived w
1 CONC ith me from a child." In those patriarchal days, even more than now, a
1 CONC s a member of Mr. Gosmer's household John Woodruff would not have been c
1 CONC onsidered one of the "heads of families," and, therefore, would not appe
1 CONC ar in the List of May, 1649. There seems, indeed, to have been no opport
1 CONC unity in the town records until on April 30, 1657 (when he was 53 year
1 CONC s of age), he is named among the arms-bearing men to whom gunpowder wa
1 CONC s served out because of an Indian attack on the town.
1 CONT : : On Sept. 17th of the same year Mr. Gosmer "bought an hundred pound l
1 CONC ot of John Topping with the housing and fences and all his accommodation
1 CONC s, with all the privileges there unto belonging in Southampton," which h
1 CONC e handed over to his stepson; possibly to qualify him as his successor i
1 CONC n the whaling squadron, which he became the same year. In that year als
1 CONC o (but probably later than the above) John Woodruff is on the list of th
1 CONC e representatives of the town houses, while Mr. Gosmer's name is omitted
1 CONC ; and he is recorded in the Plan as having, in 1659, succeeded the latte
1 CONC r in the Gosmer homestead. In 1659, also, he is for the first time menti
1 CONC oned as exchanging land. On Feb. 20, 1660-61, the 1657 gift of house an
1 CONC d land to him was registered by Mr. Gosmer, after which the name of Gosm
1 CONC er disappeared from the records. Apparently, therefore, John Gosmer, wh
1 CONC o had retired from active work in 1657, died in 1661; and John Woodruff
1 CONC , then 57 years of age, reigned in his stead. In 1661 and 1662 he was on
1 CONC ly recorded as a successful plaintiff, as on an important jury, as givin
1 CONC g in his "ear-mark," and as dealing in land. In 1663, at the town meetin
1 CONC g of May 1st, when new rules were established regarding the keeping up o
1 CONC f fences to prevent the trespassing of "cattell, sheepe, goats and hoggs
1 CONC " that had been breeding quarrels and lawsuits, he was elected and "swor
1 CONC ne impounder."
1 CONT : In 1664 the times suddenly changed. At its foundation a little republi
1 CONC c in itself, Southampton soon entered "into combinacon with the Jurisdic
1 CONC tion of Connecticote." The relation continued practically unchanged unti
1 CONC l on March 12, 1664, Charles II granted Long Island (and other territori
1 CONC es) to his brother James, Duke of York; and, against the wish of its peo
1 CONC ple. Suffolk county, with its chief town Southampton, became a part of t
1 CONC he Province of New York. In the following year, under the "Duke's Laws,
1 CONC " promulgated at the Hempstead convention in March, 1665, Suffolk count
1 CONC y was made the "East Biding (court district) of Yorkshire." Townsmen an
1 CONC d General Courts (Town Meetings) ceased to exist, and a new tribunal wa
1 CONC s established called the "Court of the Constable and Overseers." "All th
1 CONC e evils anticipated by the people were to be fully realized. All complai
1 CONC nts were met in the manner that might be expected from those who conside
1 CONC red that they were commissioned by Heaven to rule and that the people we
1 CONC re born to obey. Gov. Nicholls was succeeded by Gov. Lovelace, whose cha
1 CONC racter as a ruler may be learned from his remark, that the only way to k
1 CONC eep the people quiet was to lay such taxes upon them as should leave n
1 CONC o time for thinking of anything else than how to pay them."
1 CONT : : Many good men went into opposition, and perhaps John Woodruff was am
1 CONC ong them. For, excepting such mention in land matters as would be expect
1 CONC ed for a large proprietor, he does not appear in the records until the f
1 CONC inal entry of Feb. 22, 1669, when he joined in signing a petition to "ou
1 CONC r honorable Governor Gen'l Lovelace" that they might not be deprived o
1 CONC f "those our privilidges which at great rate wee have procured with muc
1 CONC h dificulty and danger wee have soe many years possessed." Possibly, als
1 CONC o, his absence from public life was, at least in part, due to his havin
1 CONC g grown older than his years; for he was "weak in Body" when, on May 4
1 CONC , 1670, he made the will that was proved on June 1st. He had died on Ma
1 CONC y 9th, in the 66th year of his age.
1 CONT : John Woodruff's inventory, when compared with others of the place an
1 CONC d period, shows that, for his times, he was a man of wealth and refineme
1 CONC nt; and a study of the other too scanty information within reach has giv
1 CONC en the impression that had he less unselfishly sacrificed himself to th
1 CONC e interests of his parents, his family, and his town, the man who was Ch
1 CONC urchwarden at would have taken up more room in the records. The little t
1 CONC here is, however, is to his honor; and from the requirements of the at t
1 CONC hat time important and difficult post of "impounder," to which he was el
1 CONC ected, it may be inferred that he was upright, of tact and sound judgmen
1 CONC t, and, generally, of a character and standing that commanded the confid
1 CONC ence and respect of all, both high and low, in the community. Doubtles
1 CONC s he, too, like John Gosmer, lies with the other founders of Southampton
1 CONC , in the old South End burying-ground, and his tombstone has crumbled in
1 CONC to dust; but, more fortunate than his stepfather, there are ever increas
1 CONC ing generations of direct descendants to keep his name before the eyes o
1 CONC f men.: - The Woodruffs of New Jersey who came from Fordwich, Kent, Engl

1 CONT Why Two Sons Named John? 
1 CONT * The giving of the name John to a younger brother while an elder brothe
1 CONC r John still lived in the same household, was very unusual. It is suppos
1 CONC ed that Mr. Gosmer, upon the 1650 death of his only son, Richard, name
1 CONC d this youngest step-grandson when he adopted him and made him his heir
1 CONC . The boy was not included in the 1657 list of arms-bearing men, evidenc
1 CONC e that he was then not 16 years old. As well, by matching many other dat
1 CONC es of persons named in wills, the legal transfer of an earmark, etc., i
1 CONC t has been determined that the youngest boy was born about 1650.

1 CONT   The Founding of Elizabeth Town
1 CONT On October 28, 1664, the Indians of Staten Island sold to John Bailey, D
1 CONC aniel Denton and Luke Watson, a tract of land lying between the Rarita
1 CONC n River and the Passaic River, extending westward from Newark Bay. The t
1 CONC ract extended about 34 miles between the two rivers and about17 miles we
1 CONC stward from Newark Bay, comprising 500,000 acres. It included what is no
1 CONC w the City of Elizabeth.The purchase price was 20 fathoms of trading clo
1 CONC th, two "made" coats, two guns, two kettles, ten bars of lead, 20 handfu
1 CONC ls of powder, and 400 fathoms of white wampum. The purchase price was pa
1 CONC yable in one year after the territory was occupied, indicating that eve
1 CONC n this small sum was difficult to meet in those early days. Permission t
1 CONC o purchase from the Indians was granted by Colonel Richard Nicolls who w
1 CONC as Governor of all the territories in North America. Colonel Nicolls wa
1 CONC s Governor by virtue of appointment by the then Duke of York, who had be
1 CONC en granted the territories in North America by King Charles the Second o
1 CONC f England.
1 CONT : The deed of conveyance from the Indians was delivered on December 1, 1
1 CONC 664 to John Baker, John Ogden, John Bailey and Luke Watson (Denton havin
1 CONC g sold his interest to Baker and Ogden). The four grantees took possessi
1 CONC on of the tract by building at least four houses before April 1665 and t
1 CONC hus the settlement and development of Elizabeth began. Neither Governo
1 CONC r Nicolls nor the purchasers knew that on June 24, 1664, the Duke of Yor
1 CONC k had conveyed to Lord John Berkeley and Sir George Carteret the tract o
1 CONC f land known as New Jersey. Berkeley and Carteret commissioned Philip Ca
1 CONC rteret, a relative of Sir George, as Governor of New Jersey and he arriv
1 CONC ed in August 1665 with a group of settlers and servants.
1 CONT : Colonel Nicolls and Governor Carteret worked together, despite the con
1 CONC fusion as to ownership of the land and developed the new town which the
1 CONC y called Elizabethtown, probably so named in honor of Elizabeth, the wif
1 CONC e of Sir George Carteret. Houses were constructed by the settlers and al
1 CONC so a church where the First Presbyterian Church now stands on Broad Stre
1 CONC et next to the Courthouse. Governor Carteret made Elizabethtown the capi
1 CONC tal of the province of New Jersey and the first legislature met here o
1 CONC n May 30, 1668.

1 CONT == Biography ==
1 CONT {{PGM Beyond|place=Southampton, Long Island}}John Gosmer has to have bee
1 CONC n born before 1580.  The estimated date is based on the marriage of hi
1 CONC s son John in 1618 the date of his marriage soon after 1611 to Elizabet
1 CONC h (Cartwright) Woodruff, widow of John Woodruff.   That seems to have be
1 CONC en his second marriage, because he had a son 
1 CONT son Richard by a possible first marriage. 
1 CONT Gozmur - as witness to the will written in September 1611 of John Woodru
1 CONC ffe, of the parish of St. Marie’s of Northgate (adjoining Fordwich) in w
1 CONC hich Woodruffe had named his wife Elizabeth and young son John... In 161
1 CONC 3 he was a sidesman, the churchwarden’s assistant. As such, he signe
1 CONC d - after the vicar and churchwardens - a bill of Christenings, Marriage
1 CONC s, and Burials in the Parish of St. Mary, Northgate. 
1 CONT In 1618, a John Gosmer, bachelor, joiner, of St. Mary Northgate, marrie
1 CONC d Ann Woodruff; widow (Canterbury Marriage Licenses).  
1 CONT Savage’s Genealogical Dictionary, has something to say about this, as d
1 CONC o notes 12 and 21 in The Woodruffs of New Jersey. In 1637, it is recorde
1 CONC d that there was a dispute between the Fordwich Corporation and Mr. Gosm
1 CONC er, as a tenant of the Chapter of Canterbury, regarding the extent of th
1 CONC eir respective rights over some land, which was referred to arbitration
1 CONC . The result is not known to us, but in 1638 Mr. Gosmer was himself th
1 CONC e Mayor of the Corporation, i.e., the Mayor of Fordwich. All England wa
1 CONC s then in the throes of the impending civil war, and, like other ports
1 CONC , Fordwich resisted King Charles’ illegal exaction of ship-money. In 163
1 CONC 9, the Council in Whitehall demanded from Mr. Gosmer’s mayoral successo
1 CONC r the unpaid assessment for 1638, which should long since have been pai
1 CONC d to the Sheriff of Kent or the Treasurer of the Navy.
1 CONT  He immigrated from Fordwich, Kent, England to Southampton, Long Islan
1 CONC d in 1639.<ref name=GMD>Robert Charles Anderson.  ''"The Great Migratio

1 CONT No record has been found of the departure of the Gosmer household.  Thos
1 CONC e who went (as Mr. Gosmer obviously did) to avoid payment of the hated s
1 CONC hip-money to King Charles left secretly; and that of such, no record wou
1 CONC ld exist.
1 CONT Apparently (although the Great Migration Directory does not state this..
1 CONC .) John Gosmer went first to Lynn, Massachusetts Bay Colony where he i
1 CONC s on record, and removed from there on 10 March 1639, when the foundin
1 CONC g of Southampton, Long Island, mostly by people from Lynn, was formall
1 CONC y undertaken. 
1 CONT  On or about June 4, 1640, Mr. John Gosmere was admitted an undertaker
1 CONC . At Southampton, on December 16, 1640, the name of Mr. John Gosmer head
1 CONC ed the list of the purchasers on the Indian Deed “for the land lying eas
1 CONC tward between the foresaid bounds by water from the place where the Indi
1 CONC ans hayle their cannoes out of the North Bay to the southside of the Isl
1 CONC and, later known as Canoe Place.” 
1 CONT In 1647 Southampton entered into a compact with Connecticut.  Gosmer an
1 CONC d one other were the first to represent the town in the House of Magistr
1 CONC ates in the General Court at Hartford. 
1 CONT 
1 CONT In 1650 Son Richard died.He was presumably born in England due to his be
1 CONC ing an adult at this time. And, he also presumably had a house of his ow
1 CONC n, as he had been appointed from the 3rd Ward, while his father was appo
1 CONC inted from the 2nd Ward. Notwithstanding this, Howell says that he appea
1 CONC rs to have died unmarried; and without children.
1 CONT In 1652, Mr. Gosmer was the Primus of the three Southampton magistrates
1 CONC ; and he was re-elected several years in succession. During 1655-58, h
1 CONC e again represented his town at Hartford. 
1 CONT He bought property in Boston. In 1658, he made that property over to hi
1 CONC s kinswoman, Ann, widow of Richard Carter. Why did John Gosmer Sr. leav
1 CONC e a bequest in his will to Ann, widow of Richard Carter? It could be exp
1 CONC lained in the following theory: John Gosmer Sr. was a widower, himself
1 CONC , when he married the widow, Elizabeth Cartwright Woodruff. 
1 CONT By his (unknown) first wife, he had a son, John Gosmer, Jr., who, as a b
1 CONC achelor in 1618, married as her second husband, a widow named Ann Woodru
1 CONC ff.  When John Jr. died, Ann would have become a widow for a second time
1 CONC . As such, she remarried for a third time, Richard Carter; and yet agai
1 CONC n became widowed. As Ann, widow of Richard Carter, but having earlier be
1 CONC en a daughter-in-law, or kinswoman, to John Gosmer Sr., it would have be
1 CONC en natural for Mr. Gosmer to have provided something out of his wealth f
1 CONC or this widow of his first-born son. 
1 CONT Also, it would have been natural for him, when made childless by the 165
1 CONC 0 death of his second son, Richard, to choose the name of his first-born
1 CONC , John, and give that name to his adopted son.
1 CONT  In 1657, his stepson, John Woodruff, succeeded him in the whaling squad
1 CONC ron. It is probably in the same year that this John Woodruff, identifie
1 CONC d as Sr., received from him the messuage or tenement over against the sa
1 CONC id Mr. Gosmer his home lot, which said tenement he bought of John Toppin
1 CONC g in 1657, and five acres of land, though the deed was not recorded unti
1 CONC l 20 February 1660/61. 
1 CONT Then, on 29 July 1659, he deeded "to his adopted sonne, who hath lived w
1 CONC ith me from a child, all my goods and chattells, house and lands"; to wh
1 CONC ich Elizabeth his wife consented. No other will has been found. After th
1 CONC is deed, he was lost from the town records, this man who was called Th
1 CONC e Honorable; who was considered one of the seven leading men of easter
1 CONC n Long Island. John Gosmer died in 1661.
1 CONT  In his Puritan Settlers, Hinman has written: “an examination of the Col
1 CONC ony records of Connecticut shows that Hon. John Gosmer, ...[and others
1 CONC ] were the leading men in the eastern half of Long Island in its early s
1 CONC ettlement.  Doubtless, John Gosmer lies with his fellow pioneers in th
1 CONC e old South End burying ground at Southampton; but their tombstones hav
1 CONC e crumbled into dust. - Woodruff Family of New Jersey. 2009.
1 CONT John Gosmer was listed as an undertaker In Southampton on June 4 1640. I
1 CONC n December 1640 he was part of the Indian Deed buying land. His son Rich
1 CONC ard from a first marriage died in 1650. He was a landowner but unmarried

1 CONT : : The case of the State vs. Wm. Grell, Jr., of Rich Prairie, was the f
1 CONC irst case for trial in Judge Baxter's court. Grell was before the cour
1 CONC t on the charge of being the father of the four-months -old child of Mis
1 CONC s Katie Brausen, of Buckman town. The girl was employed last summer an
1 CONC d fall in the Little Falls house, this city. Evidence of Katie Brausen c
1 CONC harged Grell with being the father of her child, and other witnesses tes
1 CONC tified that Grell had admitted his intimacy with the girl. An effort wa
1 CONC s made to show that the girl kept company with other young men in the ci
1 CONC ty, and Grell swore positively that he had never been intimate with Kati
1 CONC e Brausen. E. S. Smith was attorney for Grell and the county attorney wa
1 CONC s prosecutor. The evidence was all finished before the noon recess, an
1 CONC d the attorney's pleas and judge's charge occupied the first part of th
1 CONC e afternoon session.
