  To the Greeks, Japheth was Iapetus, the Titan god of mortaliy, the father of Prometheus, and thus the ancestral father to all Indo-Europeans.

  <div class="title">
    <h1>Descendents of Japheth</h1>
    <p> 
    <q>The sons of Japheth were Gomer and Magog and Madai and <span style="font-size: 150%;">JAVAN</span> and Tubal and Meshech and Tiras...</q></p> 
    <p><q>The sons of Javan were <span style="font-size: 150%;">ELISHAH</span> and Tarshish, Kittim and Dodanim.</q></p>
    <p><q> From these the coastlands of the nations were separated into their lands, every one according to his language, according to their families, into their nations.</q> 
    <cite>Genesis&nbsp;10:2,4&ndash;5</cite>
    </p>
  </div></div>
</div>

<div id="slideFooter" class="footer">
    Most scholars equate Javan to the Greek god Ion, son of Apollo, <br>and forefather of one of the four ancient Greek tribes: the Ionians.
    <br>In the Bible, 'Javan' also refers to Greece, as in the <i>Book of Daniel</i>, <br>which references the king of the Javans as Alexander (the Great). 

</div>
<div id="slideFooter" class="footer">
    Elishah is also known as Eliseus, not to be confused with the prophet Elisha.
    <br>The mythical <strong>Elysium</strong>, <strong>Elysian Fields</strong>, and the ancient Greek <strong>Aeolians</strong>, <br>all originate in reference to Eliseus/Elishah and his descendents.

    <h1>Book of Jasher</h1>
        <p><q>And the children of Elishah are the <span style="font-size: 150%;">ALMANIM</span>, and they also went and built themselves cities; those are the cities situate between the mountains of Job and Shibathmo; and of them were the people of LUMBARDI who dwell opposite the mountains of Job and Shibathmo, and they conquered the land of Italia and remained there unto this day.

<div id="slideFooter" class="footer">
   The <strong><i>Book of Jasher</i></strong> mentioned in the Hebrew Bible has unfortunately been lost over the centuries. <br>Multiple forgeries have been published, but only the Sefer haYashar midrash expands upon the original references found in <strong><i>Joshua</i></strong> and <strong><i>2 Samuel</i></strong>.</div>

    <h1>All the Men</h1>
    <br />
    The Almanim were a confederation of Germanic Tribes, which the Romans called the Alemanni in 213 CE. They later dwelled along the Upper Rhine and Black Forest, remained independent until becoming a duchy under the Franks, then the duchy of Swabia under the Holy Roman Empire. This confederation of tribes is the root origin of the ALLMON family name. <br />
